# Chapter 23: Town Picnic Confrontation

Saturday morning arrived hot and bright. Clearwater's annual summer picnic at Riverside Park—the whole town gathering under oak trees, families spreading blankets, everyone pretending to be one community.

I had no intention of going.

"Come on," Tommy said at my door. "You can't hide forever."

"Not hiding," I said, lying. "Just not interested in watching everyone's perfect picnic."

"Frank says the Riders are going. We got as much right to be there as anyone. And you been holed up two weeks. Time to show your face."

"I don't—"

"Emma will be there," Tommy interrupted quietly.

My chest tightened. "That's exactly why I shouldn't go."

"Or exactly why you should," Tommy countered. "You going to avoid her forever? Avoid the whole town? Or you going to face what you did and figure out how to fix it?"

I wanted to argue, to tell him I'd already decided fixing it meant staying away. But Betty's words still echoed in my head, and Frank's, and even Tommy's from earlier in the week. Maybe they were right. Maybe avoiding Emma wasn't protecting her—it was just cowardice.

"Fine," I said. "But I'm not talking to her."

"Didn't ask you to talk to her," Tommy said with a slight grin. "Just asked you to stop hiding."

Riverside Park was crowded when we arrived. Families everywhere—blankets under trees, kids running, burgers grilling. The Lions Club had set up the refreshment table, church ladies brought desserts, Sheriff Patterson kept watch from the edge.

The Riders pulled in, engines rumbling, drawing immediate attention. Stares followed us. Some hostile, some nervous, some curious. We were part of Clearwater whether the town liked it or not.

But I felt the judgment anyway.

Frank led us toward the less populated area near the tree line, away from the main crowds. The Riders spread out, some heading toward the refreshment table, others finding shade. Tommy stayed beside me, watchful.

"You okay?" he asked.

"Fine," I lied, scanning the park.

And then I saw her.

Emma sat on a blanket with her parents near the center of the park, surrounded by respectable families. She wore a pale green sundress, her hair pulled back, and even from a distance I could see how drawn she looked—thinner, paler, like she hadn't slept in days. Margaret Henderson sat beside her, talking to another woman. Robert stood nearby with a group of men.

Emma looked miserable.

The sight hit me like a fist. This was my doing—her exhaustion, her isolation, the way she sat on that blanket looking lost even surrounded by people. I'd walked away to protect her, and all I'd done was break her.

"Danny—" Tommy started.

"I see her," I cut him off quietly. "I'm not going over there."

"Didn't say you should." Tommy followed my gaze. "But maybe stop staring before her father notices."

I forced myself to look away, turning toward where Frank stood talking with Mike and Johnny. The Riders were keeping to themselves, not causing trouble, just existing in the same space as everyone else. Proving we belonged here too.

But belonging didn't make the ache in my chest any less.

---

An hour passed. I stayed near the trees, watching the picnic from the edges. Families ate, kids played, adults socialized. The Riders got some nods from working-class families, cold shoulders from others. Normal day in Clearwater—divisions visible even at a community event.

I kept catching glimpses of Emma. She barely spoke, just sat on that blanket while life happened around her. Once, she looked up and our eyes met across the park. The pain in her expression made me want to go to her, to apologize, to beg her to forgive me.

But I stayed where I was, coward that Betty had called me.

Then the Wildcats arrived.

The rumble of motorcycles cut through the picnic's peaceful atmosphere. Everyone turned to look as three bikes roared into the parking lot—loud, aggressive, impossible to ignore. Jake Morrison led them, his distinctive beard and sneer visible even from a distance.

My stomach dropped.

"What the hell are they doing back here?" Tommy muttered beside me.

Frank appeared at my other side, his expression hard. "Trouble. That's what they're doing."

The Wildcats parked their bikes and climbed off, making no attempt to blend in. Jake's eyes scanned the park, taking in the families, the food, the perfect small-town scene. His grin was all wrong—predatory, looking for weakness.

Sheriff Patterson started moving toward them, but the Wildcats were faster.

Jake spotted the refreshment table and headed straight for it. Emma was there.

My blood went cold.

Emma stood alone at the table, pouring lemonade, her parents still on the blanket thirty feet away. She didn't see Jake coming, didn't notice the three Wildcats approaching until Jake was right beside her.

"Well, well," Jake's voice carried across the park. "Look what we got here. Prettiest thing at this whole sorry picnic."

Emma looked up, and I saw her face pale. She took a step back, but Jake moved with her.

"Not very friendly," Jake said, louder now. Drawing attention. "I'm just trying to be neighborly."

"Excuse me," Emma said, her voice tight but polite. She tried to move past him.

Jake blocked her path. "Now that's just rude. I'm talking to you, sweetheart."

The park was going quiet, people noticing the confrontation. Robert Henderson started moving toward his daughter, but he was too far away.

I was moving before thinking, every protective instinct firing at once. Tommy and Frank were right behind me, the other Riders following. We cut across the park, leather jackets and purpose, and the crowd parted.

Emma tried to step around Jake again. He grabbed her arm.

That's when I got there.

"Let her go." My voice was calm, but every muscle in my body was coiled for violence.

Jake turned, still holding Emma's arm. His grin widened when he saw me. "The local talent. Didn't know you were into sharing."

"I said let her go." I stepped closer, hyperaware of Emma's frightened face, of Jake's grip on her arm, of every eye in Riverside Park watching this moment.

Jake's two companions moved up beside him. Frank, Tommy, Mike, and Johnny flanked me. The Riders and the Wildcats facing off over Emma Henderson in front of the whole town.

"Seems like she needs protection from you boys," Jake said, his tone mocking. "All these good people looking scared. Maybe we should show them what real bikers look like."

"Walk away," Frank said, his voice carrying authority. "Now. While you can."

Sheriff Patterson was pushing through the crowd, hand on his belt, but still twenty feet away.

Jake looked at the Riders, at the gathering crowd, at Emma trembling in his grip. His grin never wavered. "Or what? You going to start something in front of all these families? Make their worst assumptions come true?"

He was right—fighting him here would prove everyone right about bikers, about the Riders, about me. It would give the town exactly what they expected: violence, trouble, confirmation of all their fears.

But he had his hand on Emma.

"Last chance," I said quietly. "Let her go and walk away. Or Sheriff Patterson can escort you out. Your choice."

Jake's expression flickered—annoyance that we weren't taking the bait, that we weren't giving him the fight he wanted. He looked past me to Patterson approaching, looked at the Riders standing calm but ready, looked at the crowd watching and waiting.

Slowly, deliberately, he released Emma's arm.

"Not worth the trouble anyway," he said, loud enough for everyone to hear. "Small-town girls are all the same—boring."

Emma's face flushed with humiliation, but she held her ground. I wanted to hit Jake so badly my hands were shaking, but I kept them at my sides.

"You boys should leave," Sheriff Patterson said, arriving at the confrontation. "Right now."

Jake's grin widened. "We're just leaving, Sheriff. No trouble here."

He looked at me one more time. "See you around, brother."

"We're not brothers," I said flatly.

Jake laughed and walked away, his two companions following. They climbed on their bikes, revved the engines unnecessarily loud, and roared out of the parking lot.

The park stayed silent for a long moment.

Then I looked at Emma.

She stood at the refreshment table, arms wrapped around herself, tears in her eyes but not falling. She met my gaze, and everything I'd been holding back rushed to the surface—the apology I needed to give her, the admissions I owed her, the truth that I'd been wrong about everything.

"Are you okay?" I asked quietly.

Emma nodded, not trusting her voice.

Robert Henderson arrived, slightly out of breath. "Emma—"

"I'm fine, Dad," Emma said. "They didn't hurt me."

Robert looked at me, and for the first time since this whole mess started, I didn't see anger in his expression. Just surprise. And maybe, just maybe, the beginning of understanding.

"Thank you," he said stiffly. "For...that."

I nodded, not knowing what to say.

Sheriff Patterson cleared his throat. "Danny, Frank—I appreciate how you handled that. Kept your heads when they were trying to start trouble."

The words hung in the air. Official acknowledgment, in front of the whole town, that the Riders had done the right thing. That we'd protected someone, stayed calm, didn't take the bait.

That we were different from Jake Morrison and his crew.

I caught movement in my peripheral vision—families watching, people whispering. The church ladies who'd been spreading gossip. The parents who'd warned their daughters about bikers. The store owners who'd pulled their business from Henderson's.

They'd all seen it. Seen the Wildcats harass Emma. Seen the Riders step in. Seen us choose restraint over violence, protection over pride.

Tommy touched my shoulder. "We should give Emma some space."

He was right. I'd done what I needed to do—kept Emma safe. That didn't mean I had the right to her presence or her forgiveness.

I started to turn away.

"Danny." Emma's voice stopped me.

I looked back.

"Thank you," she said quietly. "I missed you."

The words hit with the force of everything I'd been running from. I missed her too—God, I missed her so much it hurt. But missing her and deserving another chance were different things.

"I'm glad you're okay," I managed, then walked away before I said something I wasn't sure I had the right to say.

But as I headed back toward the trees with the Riders, I felt the weight of the town's eyes on me differently than before.

They'd seen something today. Seen a distinction they'd been refusing to acknowledge.

And maybe, just maybe, that changed something.

For Emma's sake, I hoped it did.
