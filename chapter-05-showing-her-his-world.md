# Chapter 5: Showing Her His World

"Can I see it?"

Emma asks the question while I'm stacking the last boxes in the storeroom, her voice carrying that note of genuine curiosity I've learned to recognize. I turn to find her watching me with those brown eyes, pencil tucked behind her ear, smile playing at her lips.

"See what?"

"Your motorcycle. You talk about it sometimes—the Harley, the modifications you've made. I'd like to see it."

I should say no. Should make an excuse about needing to get back to the garage, about the truck being parked in the delivery spot, about a dozen reasons why Emma Henderson shouldn't be looking at my motorcycle in the parking lot where anyone could see.

Instead I hear myself say, "It's out front."

Her face lights up like I've offered her something valuable instead of just a look at a beat-up 1950 Panhead that's more sentimental value than actual worth.

We walk through the store together, Emma untying her apron and hanging it behind the counter. Through the front window, I can see my Harley parked on Main Street, chrome catching the morning sunlight. I rode it this morning instead of taking the delivery truck straight from the garage—told myself it was because the morning was perfect for riding, not because some part of me hoped Emma might see it.

The bell chimes as we step outside into the June heat. It's early enough that Main Street is quiet, just a few cars parked along the curb, Mrs. Patterson sweeping the sidewalk in front of the drugstore, Mr. Chen arranging produce outside his grocery.

Emma walks straight to my bike like she's drawn to it.

"It's beautiful," she says, and the way she says it—with genuine appreciation, not just politeness—makes something warm unfurl in my chest.

"It's a 1950 Harley-Davidson Panhead," I tell her, moving to stand beside her. "Bought it two years ago from a guy who didn't know what he had. Spent six months rebuilding the engine, another three months on cosmetic work."

"You rebuilt the engine yourself?"

"With Frank's help on the technical parts. But yeah, mostly myself."

Emma circles the bike slowly, and I watch her take it in—the chrome I polish religiously, the black paint I hand-brushed, the leather seat I replaced last summer. She moves like she's looking at art in a museum, respectful and genuinely interested.

"What's this?" She points to the engine without touching.

"That's the reason they call it a Panhead. See those rocker covers? Look like upside-down pans."

She leans closer, studying the engine. "I see it. And all these modifications you mentioned?"

I should keep this brief. Should give her the highlights and head back to work. But Emma's listening like she really wants to know, and I find myself opening up in a way I usually don't.

"Rebuilt the carburetor for better performance. Modified the exhaust system—gives it that deeper rumble you hear. Upgraded the suspension because Missouri roads are rough. Changed out the handlebars for ones that fit my reach better." I run my hand along the chrome. "Most of it's functional, making it ride better or last longer. Some of it's just because I wanted to."

"Can I touch it?"

The question surprises me. Most people either don't want to get close to a motorcycle or they touch without asking. Emma does neither.

"Yeah. Go ahead."

She reaches out carefully, fingers brushing the chrome of the fuel tank. Her touch is gentle, reverent even, like she understands this machine matters to me.

"The chrome is so smooth. Do you polish it?"

"Every week." I don't mention that I've been polishing it more than weekly lately, that working on my bike helps me think, helps me not think, depending on what I need.

Emma straightens, looking at the bike as a whole. "It suits you."

"What do you mean?"

"I don't know exactly. Just that it fits. The way it's put together with care, the way it's practical but also beautiful, the way it's clearly important to you." She meets my eyes. "It suits you."

Nobody's ever said anything like that to me before. Nobody's ever looked at my bike and seen me in it.

"Why did you want to ride?" Emma asks. "What made you get a motorcycle instead of a car?"

I lean against the brick wall of Henderson's, considering how to explain something I've never had to put into words before.

"A car's practical. Gets you where you're going, protects you from the weather, lets you carry things. But a motorcycle—" I pause, searching for the right words. "A motorcycle is freedom. It's just you and the road and the engine. No walls, no roof, nothing between you and the world. When you ride, you feel everything—the wind, the speed, the curve of the road. You can't hide on a bike. Can't pretend to be something you're not."

Emma nods slowly, like she's processing this. "And the Riders? The brotherhood you mentioned?"

"We ride together, work on bikes together, watch each other's backs. Frank taught me most of what I know about engines. Tommy's been my friend since we were kids stealing apples from Old Man Warner's tree. The rest—Jake, Mickey, Russ, Hank—they're brothers in every way that matters. We don't judge each other for where we came from or what people assume about us. We just are."

"That sounds lonely," Emma says quietly. "Needing that space away from judgment."

She's seen right to the heart of it, and the accuracy makes my chest tight.

"Sometimes," I admit. "But then you get on the bike and open up the throttle, and the loneliness burns away in the speed."

Emma studies the Harley for another moment, then looks at me with something I can't quite read in her expression.

"Could I ride it sometime? With you, I mean?"

The question hits me like a punch to the gut. The image appears immediately, unbidden and perfect—Emma on the back of my bike, arms wrapped around my waist, her hair flying in the wind, the two of us heading out of town on some empty highway with nothing but possibility ahead.

The image is so vivid, so appealing, that it takes me a second to remember all the reasons it can't happen.

"Your parents would lose their minds," I say, trying to make it sound light, teasing.

"Probably," Emma agrees, not backing down. "But I didn't ask what my parents would think. I asked if I could ride with you."

I should say no. Should explain about reputation and what people would say if they saw Robert Henderson's daughter on the back of Danny Russo's motorcycle. Should protect her from the gossip that would follow.

But Emma's looking at me with those brown eyes, and the hope in her expression makes the refusal stick in my throat.

"Maybe," I hear myself say. "Someday."

It's not a promise. It's barely even a possibility. But Emma smiles like I've given her something precious.

"I'll hold you to that."

The bell above Henderson's door chimes, and we both turn to see an older woman stepping into the store—Mrs. Patterson from the drugstore, probably. Emma needs to get back inside, back to work, back to her world.

"I should go," she says, but doesn't move immediately. "Thank you for showing me. For explaining."

"Anytime."

Emma walks back to the store entrance, then pauses and looks back at me. "It really is beautiful, Danny. The bike and what it means to you. Don't let anyone make you feel like that's wrong."

Then she's gone, disappearing into Henderson's to help Mrs. Patterson, leaving me standing alone with my Harley and an ache in my chest that has nothing to do with engines or chrome.

I climb on the bike, key the ignition, feel the familiar rumble beneath me. In the store window, I can see Emma moving behind the counter, already engaged with her customer. She doesn't look back, but somehow I know she's aware I'm still here.

I pull away from the curb, Main Street stretching ahead, and force myself not to look back.

The image won't leave me alone—Emma on the back of my bike, arms around my waist, the two of us riding toward something I can't quite name. It burns in my brain all the way back to Miller's Garage, persistent and impossible and perfect.

Frank takes one look at me when I walk in and shakes his head.

"Henderson delivery went well?"

"She wanted to see the Harley."

Frank's eyebrows rise. "Did you show her?"

"Yeah."

"And?"

"And she asked if she could ride it sometime."

Frank's expression shifts to something between concern and amusement. "What'd you tell her?"

"Maybe. Someday."

"Danny—"

"I know." I grab my gloves, needing something to do with my hands. "I know what you're going to say. That it's playing with fire, that her parents would go nuclear, that the whole town would have opinions. I know."

"That's not what I was going to say." Frank leans against the workbench, studying me with those sharp eyes that miss nothing. "I was going to say that maybe sounds like you're starting to hope, and hope's a dangerous thing when you don't believe you deserve what you're hoping for."

I don't have an answer for that, so I just head for the bay where a Chevrolet is waiting for an oil change.

But that night, alone in my apartment, I pull out the polish and the rags. My bike doesn't need polishing—I just did it three days ago—but my hands need the work and my mind needs the meditation.

I work on the chrome until it gleams, until I can see my reflection in the fuel tank, until my hands are steady and my thoughts are something approaching calm.

The image of Emma on the back of my bike fades a little. Not gone, never gone, but less immediate.

Maybe someday, I'd said.

What I didn't say is that someday feels impossible when you're from different worlds, when her father barely acknowledges you exist, when the whole town would whisper about how Danny Russo corrupted the Henderson girl.

What I didn't say is that I want it anyway, impossible or not.

What I didn't say is that Emma's already riding through my thoughts, holding on tight, and I don't know how to make her let go—or if I even want her to anymore.

I polish the chrome until it's perfect, then polish it some more, and try not to think about maybe and someday and the way Emma's eyes lit up when she looked at my Harley like it was beautiful.

Try and fail.
