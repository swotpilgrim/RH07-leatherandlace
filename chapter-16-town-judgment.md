# Chapter 16: Town Judgment

Sunday morning, I was under a '52 Ford at Miller's Garage when Frank called out that I had company. I rolled out from beneath the chassis, wiping grease on my jeans, expecting Tommy or one of the other Riders. Instead, Frank stood at the bay door with a strange look on his face—not worried exactly, more like braced for impact.

"Word's out," he said simply.

I pushed to my feet, reaching for the rag in my back pocket. "What word?"

"About you and the Henderson girl." Frank leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. "Whole town knows by now. Mrs. Patterson was at the garage first thing this morning for her husband's oil change, spent the entire time talking about how Margaret Henderson is beside herself. Apparently, the church ladies had plenty to say after service yesterday."

My stomach dropped. I'd known this was coming, but knowing and hearing it had actually happened were different things.

"What are they saying?" I asked, though I wasn't sure I wanted to know.

Frank's expression softened slightly. "What you'd expect. That Emma's throwing her life away. That you're going to break her heart. That Margaret's horrified and Robert's furious." He paused. "Mrs. Patterson seemed to think it was all very tragic and romantic, which I suspect annoyed her husband since he's the one who has to deal with Robert Henderson's complaints."

I turned away, focusing on cleaning the grease from my hands even though it was pointless—there was always more grease. "Her parents have a right to be upset."

"Do they?" Frank's voice carried that particular tone that meant he was about to say something I wouldn't like but probably needed to hear. "Or do they have a right to trust their daughter's judgment?"

I didn't answer. What could I say? That Emma deserved better than a guy whose reputation would follow her like a shadow? Frank already knew I thought that.

"Danny." Frank waited until I looked at him. "You knew this was coming when you took her to that fair. Question is: are you going to let it scare you off, or are you going to be worth what she's going through?"

The weight of that settled on my chest, heavy and unavoidable. Be worth it. How was I supposed to be worth the cost of her family's disappointment, the town's judgment, everything Emma was about to face because she'd chosen me?

"Get back to work," Frank said, not unkindly. "And try not to look so much like a man walking to the gallows. Emma made her choice. Respect it enough to not make her regret it."

I didn't see Emma until Thursday, but I heard about what she was going through. Tommy mentioned it first, stopping by the garage Tuesday afternoon with a careful expression that told me the news wasn't good.

"Ran into Betty Carlson at the diner," he said, accepting the Coke I pulled from the garage fridge. "She asked about you and Emma. Seemed worried."

"Worried how?" I kept my voice level, focused on the carburetor I was rebuilding.

Tommy took a long drink before answering. "Said Emma's parents are upset. Her mom's been crying, her dad's not talking to her. Betty thinks Emma's making a mistake." He paused. "Betty's exact words were that Emma's 'throwing away her reputation for a boy in a leather jacket.'"

My hands stilled on the carburetor. Emma's mother crying. Of course she was. I was exactly what Margaret Henderson had probably warned Emma about her entire life—the wrong kind of boy, the kind respectable girls stayed away from.

"What'd you tell Betty?" I asked.

"Told her maybe she should trust Emma to know her own mind." Tommy's grin was slight but genuine. "She didn't like that much."

I managed a small smile, but it felt hollow. Emma's best friend thought she was making a mistake. Her mother was crying. Her father wasn't speaking to her. All because of me.

The guilt that had been building since the fair intensified, a physical ache in my chest that had nothing to do with the engine parts I was handling. This was what I'd feared from the beginning—Emma paying the price for my reputation, for the leather jacket and the motorcycle and the assumptions everyone made about guys like me.

By Wednesday, I started hearing about the customers.

Frank mentioned it casually while we were closing up for the day. "Heard Henderson's lost a few customers this week. Mrs. Morrison and her daughter took their business to the hardware store. Said something about not wanting to support a store that doesn't respect community values."

I froze in the middle of locking the tool cabinet. "They're punishing the Hendersons because of me?"

"They're punishing the Hendersons because people are small-minded and scared of anything different," Frank corrected. "But yeah, you dating Emma is the reason they're giving."

I slammed the cabinet door harder than I intended, the metallic clang echoing through the garage. "This is exactly what I was afraid of. Emma's losing customers, her parents are upset, her friends are worried. All because I was selfish enough to—"

"To what?" Frank interrupted. "To care about someone who cares about you? To let her make her own choices?"

"To drag her down with me." The words came out harsh, edged with the frustration and guilt I'd been trying to keep contained. "I knew this would happen, Frank. I knew what dating me would cost her."

Frank was quiet for a long moment, his expression thoughtful in the dimming garage light. "You know what I think costs Emma more than a few judgmental customers?" he finally said. "People deciding what she can and can't handle. People making choices for her because they think they know better."

He grabbed his jacket from the hook by the door. "You walking away because you're scared of the cost? That's you doing the same thing her parents are doing—deciding she's not strong enough to handle the consequences of her own decisions."

He left me standing in the garage with those words ringing in my ears and grease under my fingernails and the weight of Emma's choice pressing against my chest.

Thursday morning arrived with summer heat that made the garage feel like an oven. I loaded the Henderson delivery into the truck, hands steady even though my heart was racing. I hadn't seen Emma since the fair.

I had no idea what to expect when I pulled up to Henderson General Store.

Robert Henderson was waiting at the loading dock, his expression coldly civil in a way that was somehow worse than outright anger. We'd never been friendly, but we'd had a professional courtesy between us. Now that was gone, replaced by a rigid politeness that felt like ice.

"Delivery," I said, keeping my voice neutral.

"I can see that." Robert signed the invoice without meeting my eyes, his pen strokes sharp and precise. "You can leave it on the dock. I'll handle the unloading."

Normally, I carried the boxes inside, stacked them where Robert indicated. The dismissal was clear—he didn't want me in his store. I couldn't blame him. I was the reason his wife was crying, the reason his daughter was facing judgment, the reason customers were walking away.

I started unloading boxes in silence, aware of Robert watching my every move. The sun beat down on the loading dock, sweat dampening my shirt beneath my jacket. I should have taken the jacket off, but some stubborn part of me refused. This was who I was—leather jacket, motorcycle, wrong side of town. Robert Henderson needed to see exactly what his daughter had chosen.

I was halfway through the delivery when the back door opened and Emma appeared.

She stopped in the doorway, and for a moment we just looked at each other. She wore a blue sundress that made her eyes brighter, her hair pulled back with a ribbon. She looked tired—shadows under her eyes that hadn't been there before, a tightness around her mouth that spoke of strain. But when she saw me, her face lit up with a smile that hit me square in the chest.

"Danny," she said, and my name in her voice made everything else fade.

"Emma." I set down the box I was holding, hyperaware of Robert's presence, of the tension crackling in the summer air.

"Emma," Robert said, warning in his tone. "Go back inside."

But Emma didn't move. She crossed the loading dock to me, ignoring her father completely, and I saw the determination in her eyes—the same determination that had been there at the fair when she'd taken my hand on the Ferris wheel.

"I missed you," she said quietly, for my ears only.

"Missed you too," I managed, though my throat felt tight.

"Emma." Robert's voice was sharper now. "Inside. Now."

Emma glanced at her father, and I saw something flash in her expression—not defiance exactly, but decision. She looked back at me, stood on her toes, and kissed me.

It wasn't a long kiss, wasn't passionate or inappropriate. Just her lips on mine, brief and soft and absolutely deliberate. But it was in full view of the loading dock, in full view of Main Street's windows, in full view of her father and anyone else who might be watching.

When she pulled back, her eyes were steady on mine. "I'll see you soon," she said, loud enough for her father to hear. A promise and a declaration all at once.

Then she turned and walked back inside, her chin high and her shoulders straight, leaving me standing on the loading dock with her father's icy stare and the ghost of her kiss on my lips.

I finished the delivery in silence. Robert signed the completed invoice with sharp, angry strokes. As I climbed into the truck, I caught a glimpse of movement in the store window—Emma, watching me. She lifted her hand in a small wave.

I waved back, started the engine, and drove away with my heart pounding and my hands shaking slightly on the steering wheel.

Emma had kissed me on Main Street in broad daylight, in front of her father and God and everyone. She'd made her choice public and unmistakable.

Now I had to be worth it.

The weight of that responsibility settled over me as I drove back to Miller's Garage. Emma had chosen me despite the cost—the customers walking away, her parents' disappointment, the church ladies' whispers, her best friend's warnings.

Whatever it took, however hard I had to work, I would be worth the price she was paying.

I had to be.
