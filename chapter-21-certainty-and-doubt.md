# Chapter 21: Certainty and Doubt

I threw myself into work after Emma left.

Sunday I arrived at Miller's Garage before dawn and stayed until long after dark, working on every repair Frank had backlogged—transmissions that needed rebuilding, engines that needed overhauls, brake systems that required complete replacement. Work that demanded my hands and tools and focus, leaving no room for thought.

It didn't help.

No matter how hard I worked, no matter how many hours I put in, Emma's words followed me. *You're just like everyone else. You don't trust me. You broke my heart.*

Monday morning, Frank found me sleeping on the garage's worn couch, having worked straight through the night.

"Danny." His voice cut through my exhausted haze. "Go home."

I sat up, rubbing my face. "I'm fine. Got three more jobs to—"

"Go home," Frank repeated, firmer this time. "Sleep. Shower. Come back tomorrow."

"I can work—"

"I know you can work," Frank interrupted. "But you're running yourself into the ground and it's not changing what happened with Emma."

Her name hit like a fist. I stood, grabbing my jacket. "I'm fine."

"You're not fine," Frank said quietly. "But you're not ready to admit that yet. So go home. Get some rest. We'll talk when you're ready."

I left without arguing, rode home through Clearwater's morning streets, and collapsed into bed. Sleep came hard and brought dreams of Emma crying, Emma accusing me, Emma walking away.

I woke at noon more exhausted than before.

The Riders noticed.

Tuesday evening at the clubhouse, Tommy sat down next to me with two beers and a concerned expression. The poker game was going at the main table, music playing low on the radio, but Tommy ignored all of it to focus on me.

"You want to talk about it?" he asked.

"Nothing to talk about." I accepted the beer but didn't drink it. "I ended things with Emma. It was the right call."

Tommy took a long drink of his own beer. "If it was the right call, why do you look like someone died?"

"Because it hurts," I admitted. "Doesn't mean it wasn't right."

"You sure about that?" Tommy's voice was gentle. "Because from where I'm sitting, you made a decision you're not sure about and now you're working yourself to death trying not to think about it."

I didn't answer because he was right.

Tommy sighed. "For what it's worth, I saw Emma at Henderson's today. Tommy made today's delivery—said she looked worse than you do. Barely speaking, just going through the motions. Robert Henderson looks worried about her."

The information hit harder than I expected. Emma wasn't okay. Of course she wasn't—I'd broken her heart, proved everyone right about me, walked away when things got hard. But hearing it confirmed, knowing she was suffering, made the ache in my chest intensify to something that hurt to breathe around.

"She'll be better eventually," I said, though the words tasted hollow. "Once the town sees we're over, they'll ease up. Her parents will stop being angry. Betty will come back. The customers will return. She'll move on."

"And you?" Tommy asked. "You going to move on?"

I stared at the beer bottle in my hands. "Eventually."

Tommy didn't look convinced, but he didn't push. He just sat with me in silence while the poker game continued and the music played and I tried to convince myself I'd done the right thing.

Frank didn't talk to me about Emma directly, but his presence said enough.

He worked beside me in the garage Wednesday and Thursday, handing me tools when I needed them, taking over when he saw me making mistakes from exhaustion, keeping watch like he expected me to fall apart at any moment.

Maybe I was falling apart. I wasn't sleeping—couldn't, not with Emma's voice in my head and the weight of what I'd done crushing my chest. I wasn't eating much either, stomach in knots. Just working and riding and existing in a gray haze where nothing felt right.

Thursday evening, Frank finally spoke.

"You know what the difference is between making a hard choice and making a wrong choice?" he asked while we locked up the garage.

I didn't answer, just waited.

"With a hard choice, you feel the cost but you know it was necessary. With a wrong choice, the cost keeps getting heavier and the reasons keep feeling weaker."

His words settled over me like a weight. "What if I can't tell the difference?"

Frank looked at me with those eyes that saw too much. "I think you can. You're just not ready to face it yet."

He left me standing in the garage parking lot with that truth hanging in the summer air.

The nights were worst.

Alone in my apartment above the dry cleaner, I'd lie on my bed staring at the ceiling, trying to convince myself I'd made the right choice. Emma deserved better than me—better than a boy whose world cost her everything, better than the judgment and isolation and pain.

During the day, I could almost believe it. Could tell myself that walking away was protecting her, that eventually she'd understand, that loving her meant letting her go before I destroyed her life completely.

But at night, the certainty crumbled.

At night, I was left with Emma's face when I'd told her I was ending it. The way her expression had cracked, hurt flashing across her features before anger took over. The tears streaming down her cheeks when she'd accused me of not trusting her. The devastation in her voice when she'd said I'd broken her heart.

*I thought you were different,* she'd said. *I thought you believed in me.*

The words haunted me. Played on repeat in my head until I wanted to scream.

I missed her. God, I missed her so much it physically hurt—an ache in my chest that wouldn't quit no matter how many hours I worked or how exhausted I made myself. I missed her smile, her laugh, the way she'd looked at me like I mattered. I missed talking to her, hearing her thoughts, seeing the world through her eyes.

I missed the girl who'd kissed me on the Ferris wheel and in front of her father and on Main Street in broad daylight, brave and fierce and absolutely certain about choosing me.

And I'd walked away from her.

Friday night, I gave up on sleep entirely. Just sat on my apartment's worn couch with the window open, summer breeze barely cutting the heat, and let myself feel the full weight of what I'd done.

I'd tried to protect Emma. Tried to save her from the cost of loving me. But all I'd done was prove her parents right, prove Betty right, prove the whole town right—that Danny Russo would break Emma Henderson's heart.

Frank's words echoed: *The cost keeps getting heavier and the reasons keep feeling weaker.*

Was he right? Had I made a wrong choice instead of a hard one?

I'd told myself I was protecting Emma by walking away. But Emma had said I wasn't protecting her—I was deciding for her, taking away her choice, treating her like she wasn't strong enough to handle the consequences of her own decisions.

*You don't trust me,* she'd said.

Did I? Did I trust Emma to know her own mind, to understand the cost and choose anyway? Or did I think she was too young, too naive, too something to make that choice for herself?

I didn't know anymore. All I knew was the look on her face when I'd broken her heart. The tears. The accusation. The way she'd walked away from me leaving me standing in that garage feeling like I'd made a terrible mistake.

I'd done what I thought was right.

But right didn't make the heartbreak hurt less. Right didn't make me miss her any less. Right didn't make the nights any easier or the doubt any quieter or the certainty any more solid.

Saturday morning, I woke on the couch still wearing yesterday's clothes, neck stiff from sleeping wrong, feeling worse than before. The summer sun streamed through the window, another hot day beginning, and I had absolutely no idea what to do.

I'd walked away to protect Emma.

But what if walking away had been the most selfish thing I'd ever done? What if I'd hurt her worse than any gossip or judgment or vandalism could have? What if she'd been right—that I was terrified of how much I loved her and I'd ended things to protect myself from watching her suffer?

The questions circled in my head without answers, certainty and doubt tangling together until I couldn't separate them anymore.

I'd made a choice.

I just didn't know if it was the right one.

And not knowing was killing me.

Sunday I didn't go to the garage. Didn't ride with the Riders. Just stayed in my apartment, windows open, summer heat oppressive, and tried to figure out what the hell I was doing.

Tommy called around noon. "You coming to the clubhouse? Some of us are heading out for a ride."

"Not today."

"You okay?"

"No," I admitted. "But I don't know how to fix it."

Tommy was quiet for a moment. "You know how to fix it, Danny. You're just scared to."

He hung up before I could respond, leaving me with that truth hanging in the air.

He was right. Part of me knew exactly how to fix this—go to Emma, apologize, tell her she was right about everything, ask if she'd give me another chance to do better. Trust her to know her own mind. Trust her strength. Stop trying to protect her and start being the partner she deserved.

But the other part—the part that had seen her mother crying and her father's anger and that spray paint on the store—that part said walking away had been right. That Emma would be better off without me. That loving her meant letting her go.

I was caught between certainty and doubt, between what felt right and what I feared was wrong, between protecting Emma and trusting her.

And I had no idea which path led where I needed to be.

All I knew was Emma's face haunted me. Her words followed me. Her absence ached like a physical wound.

I'd walked away to protect her.

But I'd never felt more lost in my life.

And the question that kept circling back, relentless and unavoidable: Had I protected Emma?

Or had I just broken both our hearts for nothing?
