# Chapter 14: Choosing Risk

The weekend after Emma's declaration in the garage passes in a state of restless uncertainty.

Saturday morning finds me at Miller's Garage working on my Harley even though we're closed. The carburetor doesn't need adjusting, but my hands need the work.

Tommy shows up around noon.

"Thought I'd find you here," he says. "You've been weird all week. Henderson girl?"

I don't answer.

"You know what your problem is? You think too much." Tommy grabs a rag. "Life's short, Danny. Too short to walk away from something good because you're scared."

"It's not that simple."

"Isn't it? You like her. She likes you. So let her decide what she's willing to risk. Trust her to know her own mind. And maybe let yourself have something good for once."

He leaves, and I'm alone with an engine that doesn't need more work.

Saturday night, the Riders gather at the clubhouse. It's Hank's birthday, so there's beer and cards and the easy camaraderie that makes this group my family. I try to participate, try to be present, but my mind keeps drifting to Emma in that green dress standing in the garage, choosing me despite every reasonable objection.

"Danny's got girl trouble," Tommy announces to the group during a poker hand.

"Thanks, Tommy."

"The Henderson girl?" Russ asks. "Heard you've been making those Thursday deliveries a lot more interesting lately."

I should deflect, change the subject. Instead I find myself saying, "She wants to try. Despite her parents, despite the town, despite everything. And I don't know if letting her is brave or selfish."

The Riders exchange glances.

"Why can't it be both?" Jake asks. "Brave and selfish. Sometimes the best things are."

"She's risking everything," I say. "Her family's approval, her reputation, her place in respectable Clearwater. All for me. And I can't shake the feeling that I should protect her from that choice."

Frank, who's been quiet, finally speaks. "Can I ask you something, Danny?"

"Sure."

"Do you respect Emma? As a person, I mean. Respect her intelligence, her strength, her ability to make good decisions?"

"Of course I do."

"Then why are you treating her like she can't think for herself?" Frank's tone is patient but pointed. "Why are you deciding what she can and can't handle instead of trusting her to know her own mind?"

The question reframes everything.

"I'm trying to protect her."

"From what? From making choices?" Frank leans forward. "I watched you fall for this girl. Watched you light up every Thursday. And now I'm watching you torture yourself trying to be noble when really you're just scared."

"What if I'm not worth what she's risking?"

"What if you are?" Frank counters.

Mickey speaks up. "You deserve something good, Danny. You're a good guy who got labeled trouble. Maybe it's time you stopped believing that label."

The support surprises me.

"It's not about deserving," I say quietly. "It's about the cost."

"Let her decide if it's worth the cost," Frank says firmly. "Trust her strength. Respect her decision. And let yourself try for something that matters."

The poker game continues, but Frank's words echo in my head.

*Do you respect Emma? Then trust her to know her own mind.*

Sunday I ride alone, taking the back roads out of Clearwater where the pavement gives way to gravel and the fields stretch endlessly under summer sky. The freedom of the road usually clears my head, but today it just gives me space to think.

Emma chose me. Knowing the costs, understanding the consequences, weighing everything carefully—she still chose to try.

And my response has been to second-guess her choice, to assume I know better than she does what's good for her, to protect her from her own decision.

That's not respect. That's not trust.

That's just fear disguised as something noble.

Frank's right. Tommy's right. The whole damn Riders are right.

I'm scared—of trying and failing, of being chosen and not being enough, of hurting Emma despite my best intentions. But Emma's scared too, and she's choosing courage over safety anyway.

Maybe it's time I do the same.

Monday evening, I show up at Henderson's just as they're closing. The CLOSED sign is already in the window, lights dimming inside as Robert Henderson does the end-of-day count. I wait on my Harley across the street, engine idling, watching.

Emma appears, locking the front door, and spots me immediately. She pauses, surprise crossing her face, then says something to her father and crosses the street.

"Danny?" She stops a few feet away, cautious hope in her expression. "What are you doing here?"

I kill the engine, climb off the bike. "I needed to talk to you."

"Okay."

The evening is warm, Main Street quiet with most businesses closed. Emma waits, patient, those brown eyes watching me carefully.

"I've been thinking about what you said. About choosing to try, about being willing to risk everything for this." I take a breath. "And I've been letting fear talk louder than everything else. Fear of hurting you, fear of not being enough, fear of being selfish by letting you choose me."

Emma doesn't interrupt, just listens.

"But Frank asked me if I respect you. If I trust your intelligence and your strength and your ability to make good decisions. And I said yes, because I do. You're one of the strongest, smartest people I know." I meet her eyes. "So if I really respect you, I need to trust your choice. Even when it scares me. Even when I don't understand how you can think I'm worth the risk."

"Danny—"

"I'm scared," I admit. "Terrified, actually. Scared of being selfish, scared of hurting you despite my best intentions, scared of trying and failing. But I'm more scared of walking away from something real because I'm too much of a coward to try."

Emma's expression shifts, hope blooming across her face.

"So if you're still willing," I continue, "if you haven't changed your mind after I've spent days being an idiot about this—I want to try. Really try. Not just agree while secretly believing it can't work, but actually give this a real shot."

Emma steps closer. "You mean it?"

"Yeah. I mean it." I reach for her hand, and she takes mine without hesitation. "I'm choosing you back, Emma. Choosing to trust your choice, choosing to try despite the fear, choosing to see if we can actually make this work."

Her smile starts small and grows, lighting up her whole face in the evening shadows.

"You have no idea how long I've been waiting to hear you say that."

"I'm sorry it took me so long. Sorry I kept trying to decide for you instead of trusting you."

"You're saying the right things now. That's what matters." Emma squeezes my hand. "So we're really doing this? Really trying?"

"If you haven't come to your senses and realized I'm a terrible choice."

She laughs, the sound bright and genuine. "You're not a terrible choice. You're my choice. And I'm keeping it."

Across the street, Robert Henderson emerges from the store, spots us holding hands, and his expression goes carefully neutral. He doesn't call Emma back, doesn't intervene, just climbs in his truck and drives away. Disapproval is clear, but so is resignation—Emma's made her choice, and he's acknowledging it even if he doesn't approve.

"My father just saw us," Emma observes.

"I noticed. You okay?"

"Better than okay." She looks at our joined hands, then back at me. "I've been choosing safe my whole life. Time to try choosing what I actually want and see what happens."

"What if it doesn't work out?"

"Then at least we'll have tried. At least we'll know." Emma's voice is steady. "But what if it does work, Danny? What if we're actually good together?"

The possibility of that—of Emma and me finding a way to bridge our different worlds, of this scared and hopeful thing between us actually working—feels almost too big to hold.

"I guess we'll find out," I say.

"I guess we will."

We stand on Main Street in the evening light, holding hands across the divide between our worlds, and for the first time since I glimpsed a yellow sundress through a store window, hope feels stronger than fear.

This might not work. Her parents might never approve. The town might never stop talking. There are a dozen ways this could go wrong.

But Emma's choosing to try anyway, and I'm finally brave enough to try with her.

That has to be enough.

"Same time Thursday?" I ask.

Emma grins. "Actually, I was thinking maybe we could do something before Thursday. Like a real date. Saturday night?"

The suggestion surprises and delights me. "A real date?"

"If you want. County fair's this weekend. We could go together. Publicly. Actually try this thing we're trying."

It's a declaration, I realize. Going to the county fair together, publicly, as a couple—Emma's ready to make this visible, to make it real.

"I'd like that," I say.

"Good." She squeezes my hand once more, then reluctantly lets go. "I should get home before my mother sends a search party. But Saturday?"

"Saturday," I agree.

Emma walks toward her father's truck still parked at the curb, then turns back. "Danny? Thank you for choosing courage. For trusting me. For being willing to try."

"Thank you for not giving up on me while I figured it out."

She smiles, climbs in the truck, and drives away.

I sit on my Harley for a long moment, the evening settling around me and the enormity of what just happened sinking in.

Emma and I are really trying this. A real date Saturday. Public and intentional and a statement to Clearwater that we're choosing each other despite every objection.

It's terrifying.

It's hopeful.

It's worth the risk.

I kick the Harley to life and ride toward home, and for the first time in weeks, I'm not running from fear.

I'm riding toward something real.
