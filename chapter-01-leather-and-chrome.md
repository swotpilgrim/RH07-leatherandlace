# Chapter 1: Leather and Chrome

The best time to ride is dawn, before Clearwater wakes up and starts deciding who you are.

I kick my Harley to life in the grey-blue light, the engine rumbling beneath me like a living thing. The sound echoes off the narrow buildings on Railroad Street—my street, the wrong side of town where paint peels and rent comes cheap. Tommy pulls up beside me on his beat-up Triumph, grinning like he always does this early, and within minutes the rest of the Clearwater Riders appear from their various apartments and boarding houses. Six of us this Thursday morning, leather jackets against the June chill that hasn't burned off yet.

We don't say much. We don't need to.

Frank Dalton takes point on his '52 Panhead, and we fall into formation behind him, rolling through empty streets toward the sunrise. This is what people don't understand about riding—it's not about causing trouble or proving something. It's about the road opening up ahead of you, the engine between your legs, and the knowledge that for these few miles, nobody's telling you who to be or where you belong. The wind carries the smell of oil and leather and possibility.

We ride past the textile mill where my mother works second shift, past the railyard where freight cars sit idle, past Miller's Garage where I'll spend my day with my hands buried in engines. The town blurs on either side, and I'm just movement and chrome and the steady rumble that drowns out everything else.

By the time we hit Main Street, the sun's cresting the horizon and painting everything gold. Frank signals and the group splits—Tommy toward the lumber yard, Jake and Mickey toward the factory, Russ toward his construction job. Frank and I head for Miller's Garage, but I've got a stop to make first.

"Henderson delivery?" Frank asks, pulling up beside me at the red light.

"Yeah."

He nods, knowing the routine. Every Thursday morning for the past six months, I've hauled supplies from the warehouse to Henderson General Store. It's easy work, pays decent, and keeps me busy. Frank taught me that staying busy keeps you out of trouble, and I've learned he's usually right about things like that.

"See you at the garage," Frank says, and peels off.

I head for the warehouse alone, the morning getting warmer as the sun climbs.

The warehouse sits on the edge of the industrial district, a squat brick building that smells like cardboard and coffee. Old Joe, the warehouse manager, has my order ready—he always does on Thursdays. We've got a routine down.

"Russo," he greets me, pushing a dolly loaded with canned goods. "Henderson order. Got your dry goods here, too."

I help him load the truck bed—crates of Campbell's soup, boxes of Quaker Oats, sacks of flour and sugar, canned vegetables, the weekly order I've memorized by now. Henderson's runs a good business, orders consistent, pays on time. Joe and I work in comfortable silence, the kind that comes from months of Thursday mornings doing the same thing.

"How's that Harley running?" Joe asks, securing the last crate.

"Like a dream."

He grins. "You boys staying out of trouble?"

"Always." I sign the paperwork, take my copy.

Joe laughs like he doesn't quite believe me but doesn't quite disbelieve either. I've learned that's about the best you can hope for when you ride with the Clearwater Riders. We're not criminals, but we're not respectable either. We exist in that space between, and most people don't know what to do with that.

I climb in the truck and point toward Main Street, leaving the warehouse behind.

Main Street is a different world from Railroad Street. Here the buildings are painted fresh, the sidewalks swept clean, the plate glass windows gleaming. Henderson General Store sits on the corner like a respectable citizen—and it is respectable, owned by Robert Henderson, church deacon and Rotary Club member. The kind of man who looks at guys like me and sees trouble before he sees anything else.

Can't say I blame him. The leather jacket, the grease under my fingernails, the Harley I ride when I'm not making deliveries in the shop truck—I know what it looks like. I know what people assume. The Clearwater Riders aren't criminals, just working guys who ride together and watch each other's backs, but try telling that to the church ladies or the business owners on Main Street.

I pull around to the loading dock at Henderson's, kill the engine, and start unloading. The morning heat is building, the kind of Missouri summer heat that makes shirts stick to your back before noon. I work efficiently, stacking boxes on the dolly, wheeling them to the back door.

Robert Henderson appears in the doorway, clipboard in hand, his expression neutral but his eyes doing the judging his mouth won't. He's maybe fifty, grey at the temples, wearing a shopkeeper's apron over a pressed shirt.

"Morning," I say, respectful. I'm always respectful with Henderson. No reason to prove his assumptions right.

"Russo." He nods curtly, checking boxes against his invoice.

We don't make small talk. He signs the delivery slip, I hand him the carbon copy, and I'm usually gone within ten minutes. That's how it's supposed to work—quick, professional, no trouble.

But today, as I'm wheeling the last dolly load toward my truck, I glance through the store's back window.

Yellow sundress.

That's what I notice first—bright yellow against the store's dim interior, bright as a canary against brown shelving. Then I see her, the girl wearing it. She's arranging something on a shelf, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail, moving with the kind of easy grace that makes you look twice. Young—maybe seventeen, eighteen. She's humming something I can't hear through the glass, reaching for a high shelf.

She laughs at something—maybe the shelf's too high, maybe she's amused by her own struggle—and the laugh lights up her whole face. Even through the window, even from this distance, I can see the genuine joy in it. Not the practiced, polite laugh you give customers. Real laughter.

I don't know who she is. Henderson's daughter, probably—I've never seen her during deliveries, but I've heard he has a daughter who helps run the store. She reaches for a high shelf, standing on her toes, and something in my chest does this stupid little flip.

I watch her for three seconds too long. Watch her finally grab whatever she was reaching for, watch her turn with this satisfied smile, watch the yellow dress swirl around her knees.

Then I force myself to look away.

This is not my business. She is not my business. Girls in yellow sundresses who laugh like that don't have anything to do with nineteen-year-old mechanics in leather jackets. That's just reality, and I learned a long time ago not to argue with reality.

I finish loading the dolly, stow it in the truck, and climb into the cab. In the rearview mirror, I can still see the corner of Henderson's store, that yellow dress a bright spot in the window. I make myself look forward, key the ignition, and pull away from the loading dock.

Main Street gives way to Railroad Street, respectability fading to honest working poverty. I park the delivery truck behind Miller's Garage and head inside, where the familiar smell of oil and metal and Frank's radio playing Chuck Berry grounds me back in my world.

Frank's already under the hood of a '54 Bel Air, but he glances up when I walk in.

"Delivery go okay?"

"Yeah. Same as always."

He studies me for a second longer than necessary, and I know Frank well enough to recognize when he's reading something I'm not saying. Frank's got this way of seeing through the walls people put up—probably comes from the war, from Korea, from learning to read men when your life depends on it. But he doesn't push—that's not Frank's way. He just nods and goes back to the Bel Air's carburetor, giving me space to work through whatever he sees on my face.

I grab my work gloves and head for the motorcycle waiting in bay two—Tommy's Triumph, making a noise he described as "unhappy" and I'd describe as "dying." The familiar weight of tools in my hands, the smell of oil and gasoline, the concrete floor beneath my boots—this is my world. This makes sense.

I settle into the familiar rhythm of diagnostics, hands knowing what to check, mind supposed to be focused on the work. Check the spark plugs first, then the fuel line, then the carburetor. Tommy rides this thing hard, doesn't maintain it like he should, and the Triumph shows it.

But I keep seeing yellow sundress. Keep seeing that laugh I couldn't hear, that smile when she grabbed whatever she was reaching for.

I tell myself to forget it. Tell myself she's just some girl I glimpsed through a window, probably doesn't even know I exist, and that's exactly how it should stay. Girls like her—respectable, clean, full of light like a summer morning—they don't need guys like me bringing shadows into their world. They don't need the gossip that comes with being seen talking to Danny Russo, don't need the judgment, don't need their reputations dragged through the dirt by association.

I've seen it happen. Good girls who get too friendly with guys from my side of town, and suddenly they're not so good anymore in Clearwater's eyes. This town has a long memory and strict rules about who belongs with who, and those rules don't bend for leather jackets and motorcycles, no matter how polite you are during deliveries.

By lunchtime, I've almost convinced myself I mean it.

Frank turns up the radio—Chuck Berry's "Roll Over Beethoven"—and I let the music and the work drown out everything else. This is my world: engines and chrome, grease and sweat, the Riders and the garage and the road. It's a good world. It's enough.

It has to be enough.

Because yellow sundresses and girls who laugh like sunshine don't belong in stories like mine, and I know better than to pretend otherwise.

I tighten a bolt, wipe my hands on a rag, and get back to work.
