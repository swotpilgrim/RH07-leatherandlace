# Chapter 6: Her Side of the Divide

Thursday arrives with Emma waiting at the loading dock, and I know immediately something's different.

She's wearing a white blouse and blue skirt instead of a dress, her hair pulled back in a ponytail, and there's a lightness to her posture I haven't seen before. No tension in her shoulders, no careful politeness in her smile—just genuine ease.

"Parents at a church meeting?" I guess, wheeling the first dolly toward her.

Emma's surprised laugh confirms it. "How did you know?"

"You look relaxed."

She considers this, then nods. "I am relaxed. They won't be back until noon. It's just us and the store." She steps aside to let me through. "Come on back. I need to check some numbers in the ledger anyway."

The back room of Henderson's General Store is part office, part storage. There's a desk covered in paperwork, filing cabinets along one wall, shelves stacked with inventory overflow. Emma gestures for me to set the boxes by the shelves while she settles at the desk, pulling a heavy ledger toward her.

"Coffee?" she offers. "I just made a fresh pot."

"Sure."

She pours two cups—mine black, hers with cream and sugar—and the domesticity of it, of sharing coffee in the back room like we do this all the time, makes something in my chest tighten.

I should probably go back for the next load, but Emma's looking at the ledger with a crease between her eyebrows, pencil tapping against her chin, and I find myself asking, "Problem?"

"Not a problem exactly. Just frustration." She takes a sip of coffee, then spins the ledger around to show me. "See these numbers? That's our hardware sales over the past year. They've been declining steadily."

I study the columns of neat figures. She's right—there's a clear downward trend.

"You moved the hardware section forward like you wanted, didn't you?"

"Two weeks ago. Too soon to see if it helps." Emma pulls the ledger back, flipping to another page. "But I've got other ideas. Expanding our hardware inventory, carrying more specialized tools, maybe doing a partnership with Miller's Garage for bulk orders on supplies."

"That's smart. Frank's always complaining about the markup from his current supplier."

Emma's face lights up. "See? That's what I thought. We could offer better prices for regular customers, build relationships with local businesses, grow that side of the store." She flips to another page, showing me more numbers, projections written in her neat handwriting. "I ran the numbers three different ways. We'd have to invest upfront in inventory, but the return over two years would be significant."

I'm impressed. Emma knows her business, understands the numbers, sees opportunities her father's apparently missing.

"What does your father say?"

The light in Emma's eyes dims. "He says the store is fine as it is. Says we've been in business twenty years doing things the same way, and there's no reason to change." She closes the ledger, carefully neutral. "He says I should focus on other things."

"Other things?"

"Finding a husband." Emma says it flatly, without emotion. "Someone appropriate with prospects and a good family name. Someone who can take over the store eventually, who I can have children with and be a proper wife to."

The bitterness in her voice surprises me. Emma's always seemed content with her life, happy in the store. But right now she sounds trapped.

"That's what you want?" I ask carefully.

"That's what everyone wants for me." Emma stands, moving to the window that looks out on the alley behind Main Street. "My parents, Betty, the ladies at church, the whole town. They've got my life planned out—marry someone respectable, have babies, join the garden club and the church auxiliary, become my mother."

"What do you want?"

She turns to look at me, and the longing in her expression is raw. "I want to run this store. Really run it, make decisions, implement changes, build something. I want to use my brain for something besides arranging canned goods and being polite to customers." Her hands clench at her sides. "I want to matter for something other than who I marry."

I set down my coffee cup, the conversation going places I didn't expect. "Have you told your parents this?"

"They don't hear it. When I try to talk about business ideas, my father pats my head—literally pats my head like I'm a child—and tells me it's sweet that I'm interested. My mother just looks sad and asks if I've given any thought to David Wright's son who's coming home from college soon."

"Who's David Wright?"

"Owns the hardware store three blocks over. Very respectable. Very boring." Emma returns to her desk, sinking into the chair. "I'm seventeen years old, and my life is already decided for me. I'll marry someone appropriate, have appropriate children, and spend my days being appropriate until I can't remember what I wanted for myself."

The parallel hits me hard—Emma trapped by expectations just like I am, just on the opposite side. I'm judged as trouble before anyone knows me. She's judged as a future wife before anyone asks what she wants.

"I know something about being judged," I say quietly. "About people deciding who you are before you open your mouth."

Emma looks up, those brown eyes finding mine. "Because of the motorcycle? The Riders?"

"Because of where I live, what I wear, who my friends are. People see the leather jacket and decide they know everything about me. Doesn't matter that I work hard, pay my bills, keep my word. Doesn't matter that the Riders are just working guys who ride together. All that matters is the assumptions."

"That's not fair."

"Neither is your parents deciding your future without asking what you want."

Emma leans back in her chair, and for a moment we just look at each other—two people on opposite sides of Clearwater's divide, both trapped by different prisons.

"What's it like?" Emma asks suddenly. "When you ride? When you just leave town and go?"

I think about how to explain it, the freedom and peace of the open road.

"It's like everything falls away," I say slowly. "The judgments, the expectations, the weight of other people's opinions. It's just you and the bike and the road, and you can go anywhere, be anyone. Nobody telling you who you should be or what you should want. It's the only time I feel completely free."

"I want that." Emma's voice is almost a whisper. "I want to know what it feels like to not carry everyone else's plans for my life."

"You could." The words come out before I think them through. "I meant what I said before. About maybe taking you riding sometime."

"My parents would die."

"Yeah. They would."

Emma smiles, but it's sad. "We're on opposite sides, aren't we? You're too low for me, I'm too high for you, and the only thing we agree on is that it's all nonsense."

"It is nonsense." I finish my coffee, setting down the cup. "But it's powerful nonsense. The kind that dictates lives."

"It doesn't have to."

I want to believe her. Want to believe that Emma and I could somehow bridge the gap between leather jackets and sundresses, between Railroad Street and Main Street, between trouble and respectable. But wanting doesn't make it true.

"I should finish unloading," I say, needing the distance, needing to do something besides sit in this back room realizing how much Emma and I have in common despite everything separating us.

"Danny." Emma stands, moving around the desk until she's close enough that I catch that vanilla and sunshine scent. "Thank you for listening. For understanding. Most people don't."

"I get it. The trapped feeling."

"I know you do. That's why..." She trails off, then shakes her head. "Never mind."

"Why what?"

Emma meets my eyes, and the vulnerability in her expression makes my breath catch. "That's why I like talking to you. You don't see Emma Henderson, Robert's daughter, good girl who should marry well and have babies. You just see me."

I do see her. That's exactly the problem. I see Emma—smart, capable, frustrated, trapped, full of ideas and dreams people won't let her pursue. I see her more clearly than is safe, care about what I see more than is wise.

"You're more than they give you credit for," I say, and mean it.

"So are you."

We stand there in the back room of Henderson's General Store, coffee cups empty, morning sun streaming through the window, and something shifts between us. Some acknowledgment that we're more alike than different, that we understand each other in ways most people wouldn't.

It's dangerous, this understanding. Dangerous and real and impossible to ignore.

The church bell tower clock chimes ten, breaking the moment. Emma steps back, smoothing her skirt, professional mask sliding back into place.

"I should let you finish the delivery."

"Right."

But when I head back to the truck for the next load, I can still feel her eyes on me. Can still hear the longing in her voice when she asked what it's like to ride away from everything.

And I know, with certainty that sits heavy in my gut, that Emma Henderson is dangerous to my carefully maintained distance, to my determination to keep our worlds separate, to every defense I've built against wanting something I can't have.

She's trapped on her side of the divide, I'm trapped on mine, and somehow we've found each other in the space between.

I don't know if that's hope or disaster.

Maybe it's both.
