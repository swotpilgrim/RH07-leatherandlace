# Chapter 2: The Girl Behind the Counter

Thursday comes around again like it always does, and I tell myself I'm not thinking about yellow sundresses.

I'm lying, but at least I'm only lying to myself.

The week passes in its usual rhythm—days at Miller's Garage with my hands buried in engines, evenings with the Riders at the clubhouse or riding out to the quarry, nights in my apartment listening to the radio and trying not to think too hard about anything. Tommy's Triumph is running smooth again, Frank's got me working on a carburetor rebuild that's teaching me patience, and life is exactly what it was before last Thursday.

Except I keep seeing that laugh. That yellow dress swirling. The way she reached for that high shelf like it was a challenge she was determined to win.

Thursday morning arrives with the same routine—meet the Riders at dawn, ride through Clearwater's empty streets, split off for our various responsibilities. I head to the warehouse, load the Henderson delivery with Old Joe's help, sign the paperwork, and point the truck toward Main Street.

My hands are steady on the wheel. My thoughts are less steady.

I tell myself Robert Henderson will be there, same as always. Quick delivery, curt nod, gone in ten minutes. No yellow sundresses, no girls with ponytails, no reason for my chest to do that stupid flip again.

I pull around to Henderson's loading dock and kill the engine.

The morning is already heating up, that thick Missouri summer heat that makes the air feel heavy. I start unloading boxes, stacking them on the dolly, focusing on the work. The back door of the store is propped open for ventilation, and I can hear movement inside—footsteps, the rustle of paper, someone humming.

Not Robert Henderson's heavy tread. Lighter. Younger.

I wheel the first dolly load to the doorway and stop.

She's there.

The girl from the yellow sundress—except today it's a blue one, the color of a summer sky, with tiny white flowers printed on it. Her dark hair is pulled back again, and she's arranging something at the counter, her back to me. Still humming that tune I can't quite place.

I should announce myself. Should say something. Instead I stand there like an idiot, dolly handle in my grease-stained hands, trying to remember how words work.

She turns around and sees me.

"Oh!" She startles, hand to her chest, then smiles. "Sorry, you surprised me. You must be the delivery."

Her voice is warm. Kind. The smile reaches her eyes—brown eyes, I notice, lighter in the sunshine coming through the window.

"Yes, ma'am." I manage to find my voice, at least. "Weekly order from the warehouse."

"Perfect timing." She moves toward me, wiping her hands on her apron. There's flour on her cheek, just a smudge, and she's either unaware of it or doesn't care. "Where do you want me to sign?"

I wheel the dolly inside, hyperaware of the contrast—her clean dress and my work boots, her neat apron and my hands that won't ever be fully clean no matter how much I scrub them. The store smells like coffee and wood polish and something baking. She smells like vanilla and sunshine.

"I've got two more loads in the truck," I say, parking the dolly near the storeroom. "I'll bring them in and then you can check everything against the invoice."

"Wonderful. Thank you." She pauses, tilting her head slightly. "I'm Emma, by the way. Emma Henderson."

Henderson's daughter. I was right.

"Danny Russo." I don't know why I give my first name—I usually just go by Russo on deliveries. But she offered hers, and it seems rude not to reciprocate.

"Nice to meet you, Danny." The way she says my name, like it matters, like I'm a person and not just the delivery guy, does something strange to my equilibrium. "You've been making our deliveries for a while, haven't you?"

"Six months or so." I head back toward the truck, needing the distance, needing to do something with my hands besides stand there noticing the flour on her cheek.

The second load goes quicker. So does the third. Emma moves around the store while I work, but I can feel her awareness of me the same way I'm aware of her. She's not nervous—not like some girls get around guys from my side of town. Just... present. Comfortable in her own space.

When I finish bringing in the last load, she's at the counter with the invoice, checking boxes against the paper.

"Quaker Oats, check. Campbell's soup, check." She marks each item carefully, her handwriting neat and precise. "Everything looks perfect."

I stand on the other side of the counter, waiting. This is usually the part where I get the signature and leave. Quick, professional, done.

But Emma doesn't just sign. She looks up at me, really looks, and asks, "Is it hot enough for you?"

It's such a normal question, the kind neighbors ask each other, the kind regular people make small talk with. Not the kind respectable store owners' daughters usually make with guys in work clothes who smell like motor oil.

"It's not too bad," I say. "Better than last summer."

"Was last summer terrible? I don't remember it being worse than this." She signs the invoice, but doesn't hand it over yet.

"July 1956. We had two weeks straight over a hundred degrees. Working in the garage felt like working in an oven."

"You work at a garage?"

"Miller's Garage. I'm a mechanic."

Her face lights up. "That's over on Fifth Street, right? My father's truck needs some work—he's been meaning to bring it in. Says the engine's making a funny noise."

I know Robert Henderson's truck. Green '53 Ford, probably needs the timing adjusted and the oil changed. But I don't say that. Just nod.

"We can take a look at it anytime. Frank—he's the owner—he's real good with Fords."

"I'll tell my father." Emma hands me the signed invoice, her fingers brushing mine briefly. She doesn't pull back like the touch burned her. Just smiles. "How long have you been making deliveries for us?"

"Since January. It's part of the job—Miller's Garage has a contract with the warehouse, and they farm out some of the delivery work to us." I'm talking more than I usually do, but she asked, and the question seemed genuine.

"Do you like it? The delivery work?"

Nobody's ever asked me that before. Deliveries are just deliveries, a job that needs doing.

"It's all right," I say carefully. "Gets me out of the garage for a few hours. Lets me see different parts of town."

"Different parts meaning Main Street versus..." She trails off, like she's not sure how to finish without being rude.

"Versus Railroad Street," I finish for her. "Yeah. Different worlds, five minutes apart."

Emma studies me with those brown eyes, and I have the uncomfortable feeling she's seeing more than I meant to show. Then she nods, like I've confirmed something she was thinking.

"I've lived in Clearwater my whole life and I've never been to Railroad Street," she admits. "Isn't that silly? Seventeen years in the same town and there are whole streets I've never seen."

"You're not missing much. Railroad Street's just working folks trying to get by."

"That's not nothing, though." She leans against the counter, and I realize with a start that she's not trying to end this conversation. She's settling in for it. "My father always says you learn about a town by seeing all of it, not just the nice parts."

"Your father say that before or after he decided not to talk to me during deliveries?" The words come out before I can stop them, edged with more bitterness than I intended.

Emma doesn't flinch. "He's protective. And he judges too quickly sometimes. But he's not a bad man."

"Didn't say he was." I fold the invoice copy, preparing to leave. This conversation is going places it shouldn't, getting too comfortable, too real. "Just said he doesn't talk to me."

"Well, I'm talking to you." Emma straightens, wiping that flour smudge with the back of her hand, which just smears it more. "And I'd like to keep talking to you, if you don't mind. It gets boring in here sometimes, especially in summer when business is slow."

I should leave. Should take my copy of the invoice, nod politely, and get back to the truck. That's what makes sense. That's what keeps things simple.

Instead I hear myself say, "I don't mind."

Emma's smile could light up the whole store. "Good. Then I'll see you next Thursday?"

"Henderson delivery's always Thursday morning."

"Perfect." She walks me toward the door, and I catch that vanilla and sunshine scent again. "Drive safe, Danny."

She remembered my name. Used it like we're friends, like she plans to see me again and remember me then too.

I make it to the truck, climb in, start the engine. In the rearview mirror, I can see Emma in the store doorway, waving. I lift my hand in return—just a small gesture—before pulling away from the loading dock.

My hands are steady on the wheel.

My thoughts are a complete mess.

She talked to me. Really talked, not just polite small talk to get through the delivery. Asked questions like she cared about the answers. Smiled at me like I was worth smiling at. And that moment when our fingers brushed over the invoice—she didn't pull away like I was dirty or dangerous or wrong.

I make it back to Miller's Garage and park the truck, but I sit in the cab for a minute longer than necessary, trying to get my head straight.

This doesn't mean anything. She's just a friendly girl, probably treats everyone the same way. The warmth in her voice, the genuine interest in her questions—that's just who she is. It's not about me specifically.

I need to remember that. Need to remember the space between us—her world of clean dresses and respectable families, my world of grease stains and leather jackets. Those worlds don't mix, no matter how nice Emma Henderson smiles.

Frank's waiting when I walk into the garage.

"Delivery take longer today?" He's under the hood of a Pontiac, but his voice carries that knowing tone.

"Same as always."

"Uh-huh." He doesn't push, but I can feel the question hanging there.

I grab my gloves and head for the bay, determined to lose myself in work and stop thinking about brown eyes and flour-smudged cheeks and the way she said my name like it mattered.

It's going to be a long week until next Thursday.
