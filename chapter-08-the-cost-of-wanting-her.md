# Chapter 8: The Cost of Wanting Her

Thursday morning, and I'm already seeing the consequences.

I pull up to Henderson's loading dock at the usual time, the morning sun bright and unforgiving. Through the store window, I can see movement—Emma arranging something on the shelves, her mother at the cash register, a customer browsing near the front.

I start unloading, keeping my head down and my focus on the work. Just another delivery, just another Thursday. Except it's not, because I can feel eyes on me in a way I haven't before.

Mrs. Patterson from the drugstore walks past on the sidewalk, her gaze sliding from me to the store window and back. Her expression says everything her mouth doesn't—disapproval, concern, judgment. She knows Emma and I have been talking. Clearwater's gossip mill works faster than any engine I've ever rebuilt.

I wheel the first dolly toward the back door. Emma appears, her smile immediate and genuine, and something in my chest both lifts and sinks at the same time.

"Good morning." She steps aside to let me through.

"Morning."

I'm keeping it brief today, professional. Not because I want to, but because I notice Betty Carlson standing near the fabric section, pretending to examine calico prints while actually watching us. Her worried frown is visible even from here.

Emma notices too. Her smile falters slightly.

"How was your week?" she asks anyway, following me into the storeroom.

"Busy. Rebuilt two transmissions and a carburetor." I stack boxes, not meeting her eyes. "How about you?"

"Fine." The word is flat, and I risk a glance at her. She's watching me with a crease between her eyebrows. "Danny, is everything okay?"

"Everything's fine."

It's a lie, and we both know it.

I head back for the next load, hyperaware of the audience. More customers have arrived—Mr. Chen from the grocery, Mrs. Williams from the boarding house. They're browsing, shopping, doing normal Thursday morning things. But their attention keeps drifting to me, to Emma, to the space between us.

The weight of their watching presses down like humidity before a storm.

When I bring in the second load, Margaret Henderson is standing at the storeroom entrance.

"Good morning, Mr. Russo." Her voice is polite, carefully neutral. Her eyes are anything but.

"Ma'am." I nod respectfully, parking the dolly.

"Emma, dear, can you help Mrs. Williams at the fabric counter? She has questions about the new patterns."

It's not a request. Emma knows it, and so do I.

"Of course, Mother." Emma's voice is controlled, but I catch the flash of frustration in her eyes before she leaves.

Margaret doesn't leave with her. She stays in the storeroom doorway while I unload, her presence a clear message: I'm watching, I'm aware, and I don't approve.

I work efficiently, keeping my expression neutral. This is Robert Henderson's wife, Emma's mother, and nothing good comes from antagonizing her. When the boxes are stacked, I head back for the final load without a word.

The third load goes faster. Margaret has moved to the counter where she can see both the storeroom and the front of the store. Emma's with Mrs. Williams, showing her patterns, her professional smile in place but the light gone from her eyes.

I finish unloading and wait at the counter for someone to sign the invoice. Margaret appears, taking the clipboard from Emma with a tight smile.

"I'll handle this, dear. Why don't you check if we need to restock the thread?"

Emma hesitates, looking between her mother and me. In that moment, I see her trapped between what she wants and what's expected of her, and the guilt hits me like a fist to the gut.

This is my fault. My presence causing this tension, making Emma choose between family and whatever we're becoming.

"Yes, Mother." Emma walks toward the back, but not before our eyes meet. The apology in her expression makes it worse.

Margaret signs the invoice quickly, efficiently, then hands it back. "Thank you for the delivery, Mr. Russo. We'll see you next week."

The dismissal is clear.

I take my copy and leave, climbing into the truck as the store door closes behind me. In the rearview mirror, I can see through Henderson's front window. Margaret has Emma near the fabric section, and even from this distance, the body language tells the story—Margaret talking earnestly, Emma's arms crossed defensively, the space between them full of disagreement.

About me. This conversation is about me.

I pull away from the loading dock, but the image stays with me—Emma trapped between her mother's expectations and her own choices, paying a social price for every minute she spends talking to me.

The drive back to Miller's Garage is automatic, my hands on the wheel while my thoughts spiral. I knew this would happen. Knew that a girl like Emma being seen with a guy like me would cost her. But knowing it theoretically and watching it happen in real time are different things.

Margaret Henderson's forced politeness. Betty Carlson's worried frowns. Mrs. Patterson's disapproving looks. Mr. Chen's careful attention. The whole town watching and judging and finding Emma wanting for talking to me.

And Emma, caught in the middle, defending something that maybe isn't worth defending.

I park behind Miller's Garage and sit in the truck cab for a minute longer than necessary.

Maybe Frank was wrong. Maybe this isn't about trusting Emma to make her own choices—maybe it's about recognizing that my presence in her life costs her too much. Maybe walking away isn't control disguised as nobility. Maybe it's just the right thing to do when you're hurting someone by existing near them.

The garage door is open, Frank already working on something in bay one. I head inside, grab my gloves, try to lose myself in work.

It doesn't take.

That night, the Riders gather at the clubhouse. It's been a good week for most of them—Tommy finished a big project at the lumber yard, Jake got promoted to shift supervisor, Mickey's got a date with a girl from the next town over. The mood is light, celebratory, full of the easy camaraderie that makes the Riders my family.

I sit at the edge, nursing a Coke, trying to participate and failing.

"Danny's quiet tonight," Russ observes, dealing cards for another hand of poker.

"Danny's been quiet all week," Tommy corrects. "Henderson girl trouble?"

I don't answer, which is answer enough.

"Her parents giving her grief?" Frank asks from his spot near the window.

"Her mother showed up during the delivery. Made it clear I'm not welcome to linger."

"That's rough." Mickey shakes his head. "But what'd you expect? She's from Main Street, you're from Railroad Street. Her folks were always going to have opinions."

"It's not just her folks." I set down my Coke. "It's the whole town. They're all watching her, judging her, whispering about her. And it's because of me. Because she's been friendly to me."

"So what are you going to do?" Tommy asks. "Walk away?"

The question hangs in the air.

"Maybe I should," I admit. "Maybe the right thing is to back off before her reputation gets damaged worse."

"Or maybe," Frank says quietly, "the right thing is to let Emma decide what she's willing to risk."

"She's seventeen. She doesn't understand what she's risking."

"You're nineteen," Frank counters. "And you're sitting here deciding for her what she can and can't handle. How's that different from her parents doing the same thing?"

The parallel stings because it's accurate.

"It's different because I'm trying to protect her, not control her."

"Is it?" Frank leans forward. "Because from where I'm sitting, it looks the same. You think you know better than Emma what's good for Emma. Just like her parents do. Just like the town does."

Tommy whistles low. "Frank's got a point, brother."

I want to argue, want to explain that this is different, that I'm not trying to control Emma's life—I'm trying to save her from the consequences of my presence in it. But the words won't come because deep down, I know Frank's right.

I am deciding for her. Assuming I know what's best. Taking away her choice under the guise of protection.

Just like everyone else in her life.

"So what am I supposed to do?" I ask, the frustration bleeding through. "Just keep showing up every Thursday while the whole town judges her? While her mother makes her choose between family and me? While she loses respect and reputation because I'm selfish enough to want to talk to her?"

"You're supposed to talk to her," Frank says simply. "Tell her what you're seeing, what you're worried about. Let her tell you what she wants. Then respect whatever she decides, even if it's not what you'd choose for her."

The simplicity of it should make it easy. It doesn't.

Because talking to Emma means admitting how much I care. Means being vulnerable in a way that scares me. Means trusting her with the truth and hoping she doesn't walk away.

The poker game continues around me, the Riders moving on to other topics—bikes, work, summer plans. I stay quiet, thinking about Margaret Henderson's tight smile, Emma's frustrated expression, the weight of watching eyes.

Thinking about whether I'm brave enough to do what Frank suggests.

The night wears on. The clubhouse empties gradually—Mickey heading home, Russ to his early shift, Jake to whatever Jake does. Tommy lingers, leaning against his Triumph.

"You falling for her?" he asks when we're alone except for Frank in the office.

"Yeah."

"She worth it?"

I think about Emma's smile, her intelligence, her dreams trapped by expectations. Think about the way she sees me—really sees me, past the leather and assumptions.

"Yeah. She is."

"Then Frank's right. Talk to her. Let her choose." Tommy climbs on his bike, kicks it to life. "And if she chooses you, brother, then you figure out together how to handle her parents and the town and all of it. That's what people do when they care about each other."

He rides off, engine rumbling into the night, leaving me alone with my thoughts and a decision I'm not ready to make but can't avoid much longer.

Emma's paying a price for knowing me. That's the reality.

The question is whether I trust her enough to let her decide if I'm worth that price—or whether I take the choice away from her and walk away to save her from myself.

Frank's voice echoes in my head: *That's not protection, kid. That's control disguised as nobility.*

Maybe he's right.

Maybe the bravest thing I can do is trust Emma to know her own mind, even when it terrifies me.

Maybe.
