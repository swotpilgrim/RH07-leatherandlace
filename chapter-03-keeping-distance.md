# Chapter 3: Keeping Distance

I'm not thinking about Emma Henderson.

That's what I tell myself Monday morning when I arrive at Miller's Garage, Tuesday when Tommy asks why I'm quieter than usual, Wednesday when I lie awake in my apartment listening to the dry cleaner's machinery humming below me. I'm not thinking about brown eyes and that flour smudge and the way she said my name like it was worth remembering.

I'm lying, but I'm getting better at it.

Monday and Tuesday pass in the usual rhythm—rebuilding carburetors, changing oil, diagnosing the mysterious sounds people's cars make that they can never quite describe. Frank's got me working on a Studebaker with a transmission that's on its last legs, and the work requires enough concentration that I can almost convince myself I'm not counting down to Thursday.

Almost.

Tuesday night, the Riders meet at the clubhouse—the old barn on the edge of town that we've claimed as our own. Tommy's there, and Jake and Mickey, Russ and Hank, Frank presiding over everything with his quiet authority.

We play poker with matchsticks, the radio playing Buddy Holly. This is my brotherhood, the guys who have my back and whose backs I have. We don't talk about feelings much—mostly just bikes and work and girls.

"You all right, Danny?" Tommy asks during a hand I'm losing badly. "You've been somewhere else all week."

"I'm fine."

"He's been like this since Thursday," Frank observes, studying his cards. "Delivery must've been interesting."

I shoot Frank a look that says drop it. He just raises an eyebrow.

"Pretty store girl finally notice you exist?" Tommy grins, showing his full house and taking my matchsticks. "The Henderson girl, right? Saw her at the Woolworth's last week—she's a real looker."

"It's not like that." The words come out harder than I intended.

Tommy raises his hands in surrender. "Easy, brother. Just teasing."

But it gets under my skin because it is like that, sort of, and it shouldn't be. Emma Henderson and I exist in different worlds, and those worlds aren't supposed to intersect beyond Thursday morning deliveries and polite thank-yous.

Wednesday I'm worse. Frank notices—Frank always notices—but he doesn't push. Just gives me the jobs that require focus and lets me work through whatever he sees on my face.

My apartment is a small box above Sal's Dry Cleaning, one room with a hot plate and not much else. I've got a bed, a radio, a stack of motorcycle magazines. It's clean, it's cheap, and it's mine.

I lie on the bed fully clothed, staring at the water stain on the ceiling that looks like a dog if you squint. The dry cleaner's machinery hums through the floor—Sal works late on Wednesdays—and traffic noise filters up from Railroad Street.

I need to keep Emma Henderson separate from this world. From my world.

She's respectable. Store owner's daughter, probably never had grease under her fingernails in her life, probably goes to church on Sundays and has parents who care about things like reputation and appropriate friends. She's clean in a way I'll never be, no matter how much I scrub my hands.

I've seen what happens when girls from her world get too close to guys from mine. The gossip starts—small at first, just whispers at the church social or the grocery store. Then it grows. Suddenly she's not respectable anymore, her family's embarrassed, and the guy gets blamed for corrupting her even if all they did was talk.

Emma doesn't need that. Doesn't need Clearwater's church ladies whispering about Robert Henderson's daughter being too friendly with the Russo boy. Doesn't need her parents asking pointed questions about who she's spending time with.

She was just being nice. Friendly. Probably treats everyone that way—the mailman, the customers, whoever makes deliveries. I'm reading too much into a simple conversation because I'm starved for someone looking at me like I'm a person instead of a problem.

By Thursday morning, I've almost convinced myself to believe it.

The Riders meet at dawn as usual. We ride through Clearwater's empty streets, and when Frank signals the split, I seriously consider asking Tommy to cover the Henderson delivery.

Just for today. Just to prove I can.

But that would require explaining why, and I don't have an explanation that won't sound stupid. So I head to the warehouse alone, help Old Joe load the usual Thursday order, and drive toward Main Street with my jaw set and my thoughts carefully controlled.

It doesn't mean anything. She was just being polite. I'll make the delivery quick and professional, same as always, and stop building castles out of air.

I pull around to Henderson's loading dock and kill the engine.

The store's back door is propped open again, morning heat already building. I can hear movement inside—lighter footsteps, that same humming. My chest does the stupid flip before my brain can tell it to stop.

I start unloading, stacking boxes on the dolly with more force than necessary. Quick and professional. In and out. That's the plan.

"Good morning!"

Emma appears in the doorway, and today's dress is pink with a white collar. Her hair is down, falling past her shoulders, and she's got a pencil tucked behind her ear like she's been doing inventory. She smiles when she sees me, the kind of smile that reaches her eyes and makes my carefully constructed distance crumble.

"Morning, Miss Henderson." I keep my voice neutral, respectful, professional.

"It's Emma, remember?" She steps aside to let me wheel the dolly through. "Miss Henderson makes me feel like my grandmother."

I don't know what to say to that, so I just nod and head for the storeroom. The store smells like coffee again, and something sweet—cinnamon, maybe.

"How was your week?" Emma asks while I'm unloading.

"Fine. Busy at the garage."

"I told my father about Miller's Garage, about you being a mechanic. He's planning to bring the truck in next week."

I pause mid-lift. She told her father about me. About our conversation. I can't tell if that's good or dangerous.

"Frank'll take good care of his truck."

"I'm sure he will." Emma's watching me work, leaning against the counter. "What kind of motorcycle do you ride? I've seen you on one before, I think. In town."

She's seen me. Noticed me enough to remember what I ride. Something warm and dangerous unfurls in my chest.

"Harley-Davidson," I say, heading back for the next load. "1950 Panhead."

"What's a Panhead?"

"Engine type. Called that because the rocker covers look like upside-down pans."

I'm giving her more information than the question required, but she asked like she actually wants to know. When I bring in the second load, she's still there, still interested.

"Do you work on your own motorcycle?"

"All the time. Maintenance, modifications, repairs. Bikes are like anything else—you take care of them, they take care of you."

"That sounds like something my father says about the store." Emma signs the invoice when I finish bringing in the last load, but she doesn't hand it over immediately. "He says you build a relationship with your business, treat it right and it treats you right."

"Smart man."

"He has his moments." She pauses, then asks, "What made you want to be a mechanic?"

Nobody asks me these things. Nobody cares why I do what I do—they just care that I do it right and don't charge too much.

"I like fixing things," I say carefully. "Like figuring out what's wrong and making it right again. Engines make sense. You treat them according to their rules and they work. No hidden expectations, no judgment for things you can't control."

Emma studies me with those brown eyes, and I have the uncomfortable feeling I've said too much. Revealed something I meant to keep hidden.

But she just nods slowly. "That makes sense. I like the store for similar reasons—everything has its place, you know what people need, you can help them find it. It's straightforward."

"Except when people don't know what they need."

"Exactly!" She lights up like I've understood something important. "They come in asking for one thing but really need another, and half the job is figuring out the translation."

I find myself almost smiling. "Same with cars. Somebody says their engine's knocking, but really their transmission's slipping."

"See? You get it." Emma hands me the signed invoice, and our fingers brush again—longer this time, just a second of contact that sends electricity up my arm. "I'll see you next Thursday?"

It's not quite a question. More like an expectation, a hope. She wants to see me again. Wants these conversations to continue.

I should discourage this. Should keep it professional and distant. Should protect her reputation and my own sanity.

"Henderson delivery's always Thursday," I hear myself say instead.

Emma's smile could melt steel. "Good. Drive safe, Danny."

She said my name again. Remembered it, used it, made it sound like something that matters.

I make it to the truck before I let myself react. Climb in, start the engine, pull away from the loading dock with Emma waving from the doorway like last week. Like this is becoming our pattern.

And that's the problem.

This is becoming a pattern. Thursday conversations that go longer than they should, that feel more personal than professional, that make me look forward to something I know I shouldn't want. Emma Henderson is becoming someone I think about, someone I want to see, someone who makes my chest do that stupid flip.

I make it back to Miller's Garage and park the truck, but I sit there for a minute, gripping the steering wheel tighter than necessary.

This needs to stop. Or at least stay contained to Thursday mornings and casual conversation and nothing more. Emma's being friendly—that's just who she is. It doesn't mean what my traitorous heart wants it to mean.

I need to remember the distance between us. Remember that girls in pink dresses with pencils behind their ears don't belong in the same story as guys with grease under their fingernails and motorcycles parked outside apartments above dry cleaners.

Frank's waiting when I walk into the garage, that knowing look on his face.

"Delivery went well?"

"Same as always."

"You're a terrible liar, kid."

I grab my gloves and head for the bay, determined to bury myself in work and stop thinking about the way Emma says my name, the way she asks questions like my answers matter, the way Thursday morning has become the best part of my week.

It's going to be a long seven days.
