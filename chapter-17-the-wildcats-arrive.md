# Chapter 17: The Wildcats Arrive

Wednesday evening, I was finishing up a brake job when the sound of motorcycles rumbled through Clearwater's quiet streets. Not our bikes—these were louder, rougher, engines pushed too hard for maximum noise.

Frank appeared in the garage bay doorway, his expression tight. "We got company."

I followed Frank to the street. Five motorcycles sat idling at the light—choppers with high handlebars, riders in leather vests over bare arms, tattoos visible, posture aggressive.

"Wildcats," Frank said quietly. "Recognized the patches."

I'd heard of them—a motorcycle club that passed through Missouri towns causing trouble. Not a brotherhood like the Riders, but a gang dealing in stolen goods and bar fights. Everything respectable people assumed all bikers were.

The light changed and the Wildcats roared through the intersection, engines deliberately loud. One of them—big guy with a thick beard—made an obscene gesture toward a woman with her daughter. The woman hurried inside the nearest shop, pulling her child close.

"They're not staying, are they?" I asked, already knowing the answer wouldn't be good.

Frank's jaw was tight. "Let's hope not. But they're making a point of being noticed."

An hour later, Tommy called. "You and Frank better get to Betty's Diner. These guys are looking for trouble."

The diner was crowded—dinner rush, families in booths. The Wildcats had taken over the back corner, boots on vinyl seats, voices loud and crude. Betty looked shaken behind the counter—one of them had been making comments every time she passed their table.

Frank, Tommy, me, and two other Riders—Mike and Johnny—walked in together. The diner went quiet. Every eye turned to us, and I saw the fear flash across faces. Leather jackets. Motorcycles. In most minds, we were the same as the Wildcats harassing Betty and making families uncomfortable.

The big guy with the beard—clearly the Wildcats' leader—grinned when he saw us. "Well, look at this. The local boys coming to defend their territory."

Frank kept his voice level, calm. "Just coming in for coffee. No trouble here."

"No trouble?" The leader laughed, a harsh sound. "That's not very neighborly. We're just passing through, thought we'd say hello to our brothers in leather."

"We're not brothers," Frank said quietly. "And you're making the ladies uncomfortable."

The Wildcat's grin widened. "That so? Maybe the ladies need to learn to appreciate real men."

Every muscle in my body tensed, fists clenching. Tommy shifted beside me, ready. But Frank's hand came up slightly. Stand down. Not here. Not in front of families who wouldn't distinguish between who started it and who finished it.

"We're ordering coffee," Frank said, turning to the counter. "Betty, four coffees to go."

Betty moved quickly, hands shaking as she poured. The Wildcats laughed, making comments designed to provoke—crude observations about the women, questions about whether the Riders were too soft to defend their territory.

I kept my eyes forward, jaw clenched so tight my teeth ached. They wanted a fight, wanted witnesses to see bikers brawling. We weren't giving them that.

Betty handed Frank the coffees. He paid, left a generous tip, and we walked out without looking back. Behind us, the Wildcats' laughter followed, along with promises that they'd see us around.

Outside, Tommy let out a long breath. "That took every ounce of willpower I got."

"I know," Frank said. "But fighting them in a diner full of families? We'd be proving everyone right about us."

"So we just let them talk like that?" Mike asked, frustration evident.

Frank looked at each of us. "We let them talk. We don't let them bait us into becoming what this town already thinks we are. The Wildcats will move on—they always do. But we live here. Our reputation matters."

I understood Frank's logic, respected it even. But the bitter taste in my mouth wouldn't go away. We'd done the right thing, and the families in that diner probably thought we were cowards or, worse, assumed we were exactly like the Wildcats and just playing it safe in front of witnesses.

The Wildcats didn't leave town that night.

Frank called at dawn Thursday—Sheriff Patterson wanted to talk to the Riders. Clearwater High School had been vandalized overnight. Spray paint, broken windows, obscenities covering the building. The gas station had been robbed, cash and merchandise stolen.

"Patterson wants to know where we were," Frank said.

My stomach sank. "We were at the clubhouse."

"I know. But leather jackets on motorcycles did this."

Frank looked exhausted when I arrived at the garage. "Sheriff came by at six. Asked about our whereabouts. I told him we were at the clubhouse all night, gave him witnesses."

"Does he believe you?"

Frank's expression was grim. "He's a fair man. But the rest of town?" He shook his head. "Mrs. Patterson called wanting to know if any Riders were involved. She sounded scared, Danny. Scared of us."

The weight of that settled on me. We'd done nothing wrong—had actively avoided confrontation with the Wildcats, had kept our heads down and stayed out of trouble. But we wore the same leather jackets, rode the same kind of bikes. In most people's minds, that made us guilty by association.

I felt it immediately that morning. The cold stares when I stopped for gas. The way the attendant stepped back from me, nervous. The muttered comments I wasn't quite supposed to hear but absolutely did.

"Bikers trashing the high school."

"Knew they were trouble."

"And to think Emma Henderson is dating one of them."

That last one hit hardest. Emma. Her reputation was already suffering because of me, and now this—the town wouldn't distinguish between the Clearwater Riders and the Wildcats who'd actually caused the damage. They'd just see motorcycles and leather and trouble.

When I pulled up to Henderson General Store for the Thursday delivery, the atmosphere was arctic.

Robert Henderson stood at the loading dock with Sheriff Patterson beside him. Both men watched me climb out of the truck, their expressions hard.

"Mr. Henderson," I said, keeping my voice respectful. "Got your delivery."

"Sheriff Patterson wants to ask you some questions," Robert said, his tone making it clear he wasn't offering me a choice.

Patterson stepped forward. He'd always been fair with me before, professional if not friendly. Now his eyes were cop eyes—assessing, suspicious.

"Where were you last night, Danny? Between midnight and four a.m.?"

"At the Riders' clubhouse," I said. "All of us were there. Poker game ran late, most of us crashed on the couches around two."

"Anyone who can verify that besides other Riders?"

I thought hard. "The night clerk at the gas station—not the one that got robbed, the Shell station on Fifth. Tommy and I stopped there around eleven-thirty for cigarettes. He'd remember."

Patterson wrote that down. "You know anything about the vandalism? The break-in?"

"No, sir. First I heard about it was when Frank called this morning and told me you'd been asking questions."

"What about those other bikers who came through town? The ones at the diner last night?"

So he knew about the diner confrontation. Of course he did—in Clearwater, everyone knew everything by breakfast.

"They're called the Wildcats," I said. "Not our club. We don't associate with them. They were trying to start something at the diner, and we walked away."

"Walked away," Robert repeated, his voice dripping with skepticism. "How noble."

Patterson shot Robert a look that suggested he should let the sheriff handle this. "I heard about the diner situation. Betty said you boys didn't cause any trouble, didn't take the bait. That counts for something."

"But not enough to keep you from questioning us," I said, unable to keep the bitterness from my voice completely.

Patterson's expression softened slightly. "I've got a vandalized school and a robbery. The only strangers in town last night were bikers. I'd be a bad sheriff if I didn't ask questions."

"We didn't do it," I said firmly.

"I believe you," Patterson said, surprising me. "But belief and proof are different things. I'm following up on all leads, including checking if anyone saw those Wildcats near the school or gas station."

He closed his notebook. "You can make your delivery. But Danny—keep your head down. Town's stirred up right now, and fair or not, you're wearing a target."

Patterson walked back to his patrol car, leaving me alone with Robert Henderson. The silence stretched between us, heavy with judgment and accusation.

"Emma's not here," Robert finally said. "I didn't want her anywhere near this delivery."

The words hit like a fist to the gut. He didn't want Emma near me—as if I were dangerous, as if association with me would contaminate her.

"Mr. Henderson—"

"Just unload your delivery and go," Robert interrupted. "You've done enough damage to my family."

I wanted to argue, to defend myself, to point out that the Riders had nothing to do with the vandalism. But Robert's expression told me he didn't want to hear it. In his mind, I was guilty—if not of the actual crime, then of being the kind of person who invited this trouble into his daughter's life.

I unloaded the boxes in silence, each one heavier than the last. Robert signed the invoice without a word and disappeared into the store without looking back.

I sat in the truck for a long moment before starting the engine, my hands gripping the steering wheel tight enough to hurt. The Wildcats had rolled through Clearwater for one night and left chaos in their wake. And the Riders—who'd done nothing but avoid confrontation and keep our heads down—were paying the price.

Because we all wore leather. Because we all rode motorcycles. Because in most people's minds, there was no difference between us and the guys who'd actually destroyed property and stolen from their neighbors.

And Emma—kind, brave Emma who'd kissed me in front of her father and the whole town—was suffering for it. Her reputation tangled up with mine, her family's business impacted, her father looking at me like I was everything wrong with the world.

I drove back to Miller's Garage with the weight of it crushing my chest. Frank had said our reputation mattered because we lived here. But what good was a reputation for being different when the whole town refused to see the difference?

The Wildcats would move on to the next town, cause the next round of trouble. And the Clearwater Riders would be left dealing with the aftermath, guilty by association, marked by leather and chrome and the assumptions no amount of restraint could overcome.

I'd told Emma I'd be worth it. Worth the cost she was paying for choosing me.

But how could I be worth it when my world kept proving everyone's worst assumptions right?
