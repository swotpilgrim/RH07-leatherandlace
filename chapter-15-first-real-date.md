# Chapter 15: First Real Date

Saturday night arrives with the weight of a thousand possibilities.

I pick Emma up at Henderson's at seven, my Harley polished to gleaming and my nerves wound tight. She appears in a pink dress with a white cardigan, her hair down and curling around her shoulders, and the sight of her makes my chest do that stupid flip I've stopped fighting.

"You look beautiful," I say, and mean it.

Emma's smile is radiant. "You clean up pretty nice yourself."

I'm wearing my best jeans and a button-down shirt under my leather jacket—still me, but making an effort. For her. For this.

"Ready?" I ask.

"More than ready."

The county fair is about twenty miles outside Clearwater, which means we'll see people we know but not exclusively Clearwater residents. It's public enough to make a statement but not so public that we're walking Main Street hand in hand.

Emma climbs on the back of my Harley with only a moment's hesitation, her arms wrapping around my waist like she's done this a thousand times instead of never. The contact—her pressed against my back, holding on tight—makes it hard to focus on the road.

"You okay?" I call back over the engine.

"Perfect!" she shouts, and I can hear the smile in her voice.

The ride to the fair takes thirty minutes, the evening air warm and the sunset painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. Emma holds on the whole way, and by the time we arrive I've stopped being nervous about the bike and started being nervous about everything else.

The county fair is exactly what it should be—bright lights strung between booths, the smell of fried food and cotton candy, carousel music mixing with game barkers calling for customers. Families stream through the gates, teenagers in clusters, couples holding hands.

We're one of those couples now, I realize as Emma takes my hand and pulls me toward the entrance.

"I haven't been to the fair in years," Emma says, her excitement infectious. "My parents always said it was too common, too rowdy. But I used to love it when I was little."

"Too common and rowdy," I repeat. "Sounds perfect for me."

She laughs, squeezing my hand. "Sounds perfect for us."

Us. The word settles warm in my chest.

We wander through the fairgrounds, Emma pointing at booths she wants to try and games she remembers. I'm hyperaware of the stares—people from Clearwater who recognize Emma Henderson with Danny Russo, the motorcycle guy. Mrs. Williams from the boarding house does a double-take. Mr. Chen nods politely but his expression is carefully neutral.

Emma either doesn't notice or doesn't care. She just keeps walking, keeps smiling, keeps holding my hand like it's the most natural thing in the world.

"Try to win me something," Emma says, stopping at a game booth with milk bottles stacked in pyramids.

"These games are all rigged."

"I know. Try anyway."

I hand over a dollar, take the baseballs the operator gives me, and proceed to knock down exactly zero milk bottles despite my best efforts. Emma laughs—not at me, but with genuine joy at the absurdity of it.

"Told you they're rigged."

"You did. But you tried, and that's what counts." She kisses my cheek, quick and spontaneous, and my brain short-circuits.

We move to the next booth, where Emma throws rings at glass bottles with no more success than I had. By the third booth—dart balloons—we're both laughing at our complete lack of carnival game skills.

"Cotton candy?" Emma suggests.

"Only if it's pink."

"Obviously pink. What kind of heathen eats blue cotton candy?"

The vendor hands us a cloud of spun sugar, impossibly pink and sticky, and Emma tears off a piece with her fingers. "This is terrible for you," she says, popping it in her mouth.

"That's what makes it good."

We share the cotton candy while wandering, Emma's fingers occasionally brushing mine as we both reach for the same piece. The sun's set completely now, and the fairground lights glow against the darkening sky.

"Ferris wheel?" Emma asks, pointing to the giant wheel lit up and rotating slowly.

"You're not afraid of heights?"

"Not even a little."

We join the line, and I notice Betty Carlson and her fiancé—David something, the hardware store owner's son—standing a few groups ahead of us. Betty sees us, her expression shifting from surprise to concern to something that might be disapproval.

Emma sees them too and her grip on my hand tightens slightly, but she doesn't let go.

When our turn comes, Emma climbs into the gondola with the excitement of a kid, and I settle beside her as the operator locks the safety bar. The wheel starts moving, lifting us up and away from the ground in slow, measured increments.

Clearwater spreads below us as we rise—the fairgrounds with its lights and music, the parking lot with my Harley gleaming under a streetlight, the highway stretching toward home, and beyond that the town itself, small and contained and full of judgment we're choosing to ignore.

"It's beautiful up here," Emma says, leaning against me.

"Yeah. It is."

We reach the top of the wheel and stop, the gondola swaying gently. Stars overhead, music drifting up from below, Emma's warmth against my side, and the whole world feeling impossibly perfect.

Emma turns to look at me, and in the colored lights from the fair I can see her eyes—brown and warm and full of something that makes my heart stutter.

"Danny?"

"Yeah?"

"Can I kiss you?"

The question surprises me. I expected to ask her, expected to be the one taking the risk. But Emma asking—Emma choosing this moment, this first kiss—feels exactly right.

"Yeah," I say, voice rough. "You can kiss me."

She leans in, and I meet her halfway, and when our lips touch the entire fair disappears. There's just Emma, soft and sweet with cotton candy sugar on her lips, her hand finding mine, the world narrowing to this gondola at the top of the Ferris wheel where everything else falls away.

The kiss is careful, tentative, perfect. Everything a first kiss should be.

When we pull apart, Emma's smiling and her lipstick is slightly smudged and my heart is completely, irrevocably gone.

"Wow," she says.

"Yeah. Wow."

The Ferris wheel starts moving again, bringing us back down to earth, but I'm still floating. Emma rests her head on my shoulder, her hand in mine, and I've never felt anything as right as this moment.

We exit the ride, Emma's lipstick still smudged and both of us grinning like idiots, and nearly walk straight into Betty and David.

"Emma," Betty says, her surprise evident. "I didn't expect to see you here."

"Hi, Betty. David." Emma's voice is cheerful, confident. "This is Danny. Danny, this is Betty Carlson and David Wright."

I nod politely. "Nice to meet you."

David nods back, clearly uncomfortable. Betty's smile is tight, her concern for Emma written all over her face.

"I didn't know you were seeing anyone," Betty says to Emma, the unspoken question clear: *Why him?*

"We're on our first date, actually," Emma says, and her hand finds mine again, holding tight. "Danny's been making deliveries to my father's store, and we've become friends. More than friends now, I guess."

The public declaration—the confidence in Emma's voice as she claims this, claims us, claims me in front of her friend and the respectable boy everyone expected her to choose—makes something in my chest expand.

Betty glances at our joined hands, at my leather jacket, at the smudged lipstick on Emma's mouth. Her concern deepens. "Emma, can we talk? Just for a minute?"

"We're actually heading to get food," Emma says pleasantly but firmly. "But I'll call you this week. It was nice seeing you both."

She pulls me away before Betty can object, and we don't stop until we're several booths away.

"Sorry about that," Emma says.

"Don't apologize. She cares about you."

"She thinks I'm making a mistake." Emma looks up at me. "Are you uncomfortable? With people seeing us, with Betty's judgment?"

"I'm uncomfortable that it costs you," I admit. "But uncomfortable enough to walk away? No."

Emma's smile returns. "Good. Because I'm hungry and you promised me fair food."

We get corn dogs and french fries and lemonade, finding a picnic table near the edge of the fairgrounds where we can watch people passing by. Emma tells me about coming to the fair as a child, about the year she won a goldfish that died three days later, about her father winning her mother a stuffed bear on their first date.

"My father was different before the store took over his whole life," Emma says. "More fun. Less worried about what people think."

"You think he'll ever accept this? Us?"

"I don't know," Emma admits. "Maybe. If we prove we're worth accepting. If I prove I made the right choice."

"No pressure."

She laughs. "We'll figure it out. Together."

Together. That word again, settling warm and right.

We stay at the fair until it starts closing, riding the Tilt-A-Whirl and the carousel and watching Emma try to win a goldfish at the ping-pong ball toss (she fails, but laughs the whole time). Every moment feels like proof that this crazy thing between us might actually work.

The ride home is quieter, Emma's arms around my waist and her head resting against my back. When I pull up to Henderson's—her parents are still up, lights on in the apartment above the store—Emma climbs off reluctantly.

"Best first date ever," she says.

"Yeah?"

"Definitely." She kisses me again, quick and sweet in the shadow of her father's store. "Thursday?"

"Thursday. But maybe we could do something before then? Another date?"

Emma's smile could light up the whole street. "I'd like that."

She walks toward the store entrance, pausing at the door to wave. I wait until she's safely inside before riding away, the night air cool and my thoughts a mess of hope and fear and possibility.

Betty's judgment. Her parents' disapproval. The town's whispers. The cost Emma's paying for choosing me.

All of it matters. All of it's real.

But so is this: Emma's hand in mine, her arms around my waist on the bike, her lips cotton-candy sweet, her voice calling me hers in front of people who expected her to choose someone else.

So is the way she looks at me like I'm worth the risk, like we're worth the fight, like this thing between us could actually be real.

I'm in too deep now. Completely, utterly fallen for Emma Henderson.

And instead of terrifying me, it fills me with something that might be hope.

This won't be easy. Her parents might never fully approve. The town might never stop talking. There will be obstacles and judgment and costs we haven't even encountered yet.

But we'll face them together.

And maybe—just maybe—that's enough.
