# Chapter 4: Small Talk, Big Problems

The Thursdays start blurring together, and that should worry me more than it does.

Week three, Emma's wearing the yellow sundress again—the one from that first glimpse through the window—and she needs help moving a shipment of canned goods from the storeroom to the shelves. It's not heavy work, nothing she couldn't handle herself with enough time, but she asks and I don't say no.

We work in comfortable silence for a while, me lifting boxes from the storeroom, Emma arranging them on the shelves with the labels facing out just so. The store's empty this early, just us and the coffee smell and morning sunshine streaming through the front windows.

"What do you think?" Emma steps back from a display she's arranged—soup cans in a pyramid. "Too much?"

"It's soup."

She laughs, that genuine sound I've started looking forward to. "That's what I thought. But my mother says presentation matters, even for Campbell's."

"Your mother's probably right." I set down another box. "But it's still soup."

"Practical. I like that." Emma starts unpacking the box, and I catch myself watching how her hands move, quick and efficient. "Do you listen to Elvis?"

The question comes out of nowhere.

"Sometimes. Not my favorite."

"What is your favorite?"

"Chuck Berry. Little Richard. Jerry Lee Lewis."

Emma grins. "The dangerous ones."

"The good ones," I correct, but she's not wrong. There's something about the raw energy in Chuck Berry's guitar, the rebellion in Jerry Lee Lewis pounding those piano keys, that speaks to something in me the smoother crooners don't touch.

"I like Elvis," Emma admits, still arranging soup cans. "But my father says rock and roll is corrupting the youth of America."

"What do you say?"

She looks at me, smile playing at her lips. "I say it's just music. And people have been worrying about corrupting the youth since before we were born. They'll find something new to worry about next year."

I almost smile. Actually almost smile, and I'm not a guy who smiles much.

Week four, it's raining—that heavy Missouri summer rain that turns the streets slick and makes the humidity worse. Emma's got the invoice ready when I arrive, but she also has coffee poured, two cups sitting on the counter.

"You look soaked," she says by way of greeting.

I am soaked. The rain caught me between the truck and the store, and my shirt's sticking to my shoulders.

"It's just water."

"It's coffee." She pushes one of the cups toward me. "Black, because you seem like a black coffee person. Am I right?"

She's right. I don't know how she guessed, but she's right.

I should say no thank you, sign the invoice, and leave. Instead I wrap my hands around the warm cup and take a drink. It's good coffee, better than the stuff we make at the garage.

"Thank you."

"You're welcome." Emma leans against the counter, cradling her own cup. Hers has cream and sugar, I notice. Sweet, like her. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"What's it like? Riding with the Clearwater Riders?"

Most people don't ask about the Riders with genuine curiosity. They ask with judgment already baked in, looking for confirmation that we're trouble. But Emma just sounds interested.

"It's freedom," I say carefully. "It's knowing you've got brothers who'll show up if you need them. It's the road and the bikes and not answering to anyone except the people who've earned the right to your loyalty."

"That sounds nice. The loyalty part, I mean."

"It is."

"Do you ever get tired of people assuming the worst? Because of the motorcycles and the leather jackets?"

I study her over my coffee cup. "Every day."

"That's not fair." She says it simply, like it's a fact rather than an opinion.

"Fair's got nothing to do with it. It's just how things are."

"Doesn't mean it's right."

I don't have an answer for that, so I just drink my coffee and try not to notice how the rain's made Emma's hair curl slightly around her face, how the grey light through the window makes her eyes look darker.

Week five, Emma asks my opinion on the store layout. She wants to move the hardware section closer to the front, thinks it'll increase sales, but her father says it's fine where it is.

"What do you think?" She's got a pencil behind her ear again, a habit I've learned means she's been doing paperwork. "As a customer, would you notice if the hammers and nails were up front instead of in back?"

"I'm not really your customer base."

"You could be. Miller's Garage orders supplies sometimes, doesn't it?"

She has a point.

"Front makes sense," I admit. "Guys coming in for hardware don't want to walk past the dress patterns and yarn to get there. They want to grab what they need and get out."

Emma's face lights up. "Exactly! That's what I told my father. But he says we've always had hardware in the back."

"How long's always?"

"Twenty years, since he bought the store."

"Maybe it's time for a change."

She beams at me like I've said something brilliant instead of obvious, and I feel that dangerous warmth spreading through my chest again.

Week six, Tommy finally corners me at the garage.

"You're spending a lot of time at Henderson's," he says, not quite casually, while we're working on his Triumph's chain.

"Same amount of time as always. Thursday mornings."

"Uh-huh. And Thursday mornings are taking longer these days."

"The deliveries are the same size."

Tommy grins, that knowing grin that says he sees right through me. "Sure they are. And you're not counting down to Thursdays or anything."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"The pretty store girl, Danny. Emma Henderson. You're falling for her."

"I'm not—" I start, but Tommy cuts me off.

"It's okay if you are. She's beautiful, she's nice, and from what I hear, she's smart too. Could do worse than Emma Henderson."

"She's the store owner's daughter," I say flatly. "And I'm a mechanic who rides a motorcycle. We're not in the same world."

"So? Worlds can overlap."

"Not these worlds."

But Tommy's grin doesn't fade, and I know he doesn't believe me. Worse, I'm not sure I believe me anymore either.

That night at the clubhouse, the teasing spreads. The Riders are merciless in their good-natured way—asking if I need help carrying boxes, if I've learned about retail yet, if Emma likes bad boys or if I'm going to have to clean up my act.

"She doesn't like me," I insist, losing another poker hand while they laugh. "She's just friendly."

"To everyone?" Russ asks. "Or just to you?"

I don't have an answer.

Frank, presiding over the chaos with his usual quiet authority, just watches me with that knowing look. When the others are distracted by a new hand, he leans over.

"You're allowed to want something good, Danny."

"I know."

"Do you?" His voice is low enough only I can hear. "Because from where I'm sitting, you're working real hard to convince yourself you don't deserve her before you even try."

Week seven, I walk into Henderson's to find Emma rearranging the hardware section, moving it toward the front just like she wanted.

"You convinced him." I nod toward the hammers and nails in their new prominent location.

Emma grins, triumphant. "I wore him down. And I cited customer feedback."

"Customer feedback?"

"You." Her eyes sparkle with mischief. "I told him a mechanic said it made more sense up front."

"You didn't tell him which mechanic."

"Nope." She doesn't sound sorry about it.

We fall into our routine—me bringing in boxes, Emma checking the invoice, the two of us talking about nothing and everything. She tells me about a customer who couldn't remember what they came in for and bought shoe polish instead of boot laces. I tell her about a guy who brought his car in complaining it wouldn't start and hadn't realized he was out of gas.

Emma laughs, and I catch myself wanting to make her laugh again, wanting to be the reason for that sound.

"Can I ask you something?" Emma says when I'm about to leave, invoice signed and tucked in my pocket.

"Sure."

"Do you ever want to leave Clearwater? Just ride away and not come back?"

The question catches me off guard with its honesty.

"Sometimes," I admit. "When the town feels too small and the judgments feel too heavy. But then I think about the Riders, and Frank, and the garage, and..." I trail off, not sure how to finish.

"And it's home," Emma finishes quietly. "Even when it's hard."

"Yeah. Even then."

She nods like she understands, and I think maybe she does. Maybe she feels the same weight of small-town expectations, the same pull between wanting to escape and wanting to belong.

"I'll see you next week," Emma says, and it's not a question anymore. It's a certainty we both accept.

"Next week," I agree.

By week eight, I've stopped pretending I'm not looking forward to Thursdays. Stopped pretending Emma Henderson is just the girl who happens to be at the store during deliveries. Stopped pretending I don't notice everything about her—how she hums when she's concentrating, how she taps the pencil against her chin when she's thinking, how her smile is different when it's genuine versus when she's being polite to customers.

I'm falling for Emma Henderson, and everyone can see it—Tommy with his knowing grins, Frank with his quiet observations, the Riders with their teasing.

Everyone can see it except maybe Emma herself.

Or maybe she can see it too, and she's not running away.

That thought is more terrifying than anything else.
