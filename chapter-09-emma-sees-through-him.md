# Chapter 9: Emma Sees Through Him

I make Thursday's delivery in record time.

Unload the boxes, stack them efficiently, get the invoice signed, and leave. That's the plan. Quick, professional, minimal conversation. It's better for Emma this way—less time with me means less ammunition for the gossips, less for her mother to worry about, less cost to her reputation.

I've got it all figured out.

Emma has other ideas.

I'm wheeling the second dolly in when she appears, arms crossed, that crease between her eyebrows that means she's figured something out.

"You're being weird."

I keep working. "Just busy. Got a lot to do back at the garage."

"Danny."

The way she says my name—not quite angry, not quite hurt, but somewhere in between—makes me pause.

"What's going on?" Emma asks. "Last week we talked for twenty minutes. This week you've barely looked at me."

"I'm just making the delivery."

"You're avoiding me."

She's right, of course. Emma sees through my deflection like it's glass. But I keep trying anyway, wheeling the dolly back toward the truck.

"I'm not avoiding you. I'm working."

"Then look at me and say that."

I stop, turn. Emma's standing in the doorway between the storeroom and the loading dock, morning sun backlighting her. Her expression is a mixture of confusion and determination.

I meet her eyes. "I'm working."

"Liar."

The word is soft but certain. Emma moves closer, lowering her voice so any customers inside won't hear.

"What happened? Did I do something wrong? Say something that made you uncomfortable?"

"No." The denial comes immediately, forcefully. "You didn't do anything wrong."

"Then why are you pulling back? Why won't you even talk to me properly?"

I head for the truck, needing the distance, needing to not have this conversation where anyone could see or hear. But Emma follows me, catching my arm before I can climb in the cab.

"Danny, please. Just tell me what's going on."

The touch of her hand on my arm, the genuine concern in her voice—it breaks something in my carefully constructed walls.

"Your mother doesn't want you talking to me," I say, keeping my voice low. "The whole town's watching you, judging you. I saw Betty Carlson looking worried. I saw Mrs. Patterson's face when she walked past. They're all thinking you're making a mistake being friendly with me."

Emma's hand drops but she doesn't step back. "So?"

"So you're paying a price for it. For knowing me, for talking to me. Your reputation—"

"My reputation is mine to manage," Emma interrupts. "Not yours."

"Emma, you don't understand—"

"Don't I?" Now there's an edge to her voice, sharp enough to cut. "What don't I understand, Danny? That people talk? That my mother doesn't approve? That Betty thinks I'm making a mistake? You think I don't already know all of that?"

I stare at her, caught off guard by the intensity in her expression.

"Of course I know," Emma continues. "I've lived in this town my whole life. I know exactly how it works, what people say, what they think. I know my mother had a talk with me after last Thursday's delivery about being too friendly with the help. I know Betty cornered me at church to express concern about my choices. I know, Danny. I know all of it."

"Then you understand why I need to back off. Why this—" I gesture between us, "—whatever this is, it's not worth what it's costing you."

Emma's eyes flash. "You need to back off? You decided that? All by yourself?"

"I'm trying to protect you."

"From what? From making my own choices?" Emma's voice rises slightly, then drops again as she controls it. "From deciding for myself who I want to spend time with? From figuring out what I think is worth the cost?"

"From me," I say flatly. "From the damage my reputation does to yours. From the judgment and the gossip and the way your mother looked at you last week. I'm trying to protect you from me."

The words hang in the air between us.

Emma studies me for a long moment, and then something shifts in her expression. The anger fades, replaced by something that might be disappointment.

"You really don't get it, do you?" she says quietly.

"Get what?"

"That you're doing the same thing everyone else does. Deciding what's best for me without asking what I want. Taking away my choice because you think you know better." Emma shakes her head. "I thought you were different, Danny. I thought you saw me as someone capable of making her own decisions. But you're just like them—my parents, Betty, the whole town. All of you think you know what's right for Emma Henderson better than Emma Henderson does."

The comparison stings because it echoes Frank's words, because it's true, because I know it's true and did it anyway.

"That's not—" I start, but Emma cuts me off.

"Isn't it? You decided I can't handle the gossip. You decided I don't understand what I'm risking. You decided to pull back and not even tell me why, just leave me wondering what I did wrong. You made all these decisions about us without including me in any of them." Her voice cracks slightly. "How is that different from my mother deciding who I should marry? From my father deciding I can't run the store? From everyone else in this town deciding my life for me?"

I don't have an answer. Can't find words to defend what I've done when she's laid it out so clearly.

"I thought you saw me," Emma continues, softer now. "Really saw me. Not as Robert Henderson's daughter or the good girl from Main Street, but as me. As someone with a brain and opinions and the right to choose her own path, even if that path is harder than the safe one."

"I do see you," I manage.

"Then respect what you see. Respect that I'm strong enough to handle gossip. Smart enough to understand consequences. Brave enough to choose what I want even when it costs me something." Emma's eyes are bright, either with anger or tears or both. "Don't take away my choice and call it protection. That's not protection, Danny. That's just another cage."

The words land like punches, each one accurate and devastating.

Before I can respond, before I can figure out what to say to that raw honesty, Robert Henderson's voice calls from inside the store.

"Emma! Customer needs help with the hardware order."

Emma glances back toward the store, then at me. The disappointment in her expression is worse than anger would be.

"I have to go." She starts walking away, then pauses and looks back. "I thought you were different. I thought you understood what it's like to have everyone decide who you are before you open your mouth. I guess I was wrong."

Then she's gone, disappearing into Henderson's General Store, leaving me standing in the parking lot with the delivery truck and the wreckage of my good intentions.

I climb in the cab, start the engine, pull away from the loading dock.

The drive back to Miller's Garage passes in a blur. Emma's words echo in my head, relentless and true: *You're doing the same thing everyone else does. Deciding what's best for me without asking what I want.*

She's right. God, she's right.

I thought I was being noble, protecting her from the costs of knowing me. But I was really just being a coward—afraid to let her make her own choice because what if she chose me and regretted it? What if I let her decide and she got hurt anyway? Easier to make the choice for her, to control the outcome, to protect myself from the possibility of being chosen and still causing her pain.

I park behind the garage and sit in the truck, gripping the steering wheel.

Frank was right. Emma's right. Tommy, the whole damn Riders were right.

I've been treating Emma like someone who needs protecting instead of someone who deserves respect. Taking away her agency under the guise of caring about her. Making decisions about her life because I thought I knew better.

Just like everyone else in Clearwater does to her.

And the worst part? She saw through it immediately. Saw exactly what I was doing and called me on it, and I didn't have a defense because there isn't one.

I thought I was different. Thought I understood Emma in ways other people didn't. But when it came down to it, I did the same thing they all do—decided for her what she could and couldn't handle, what she should and shouldn't risk.

No wonder she looked disappointed.

I finally climb out of the truck and head into the garage. Frank's under the hood of a Ford pickup, but he straightens when he sees my face.

"That bad?"

"Worse. She called me on my bullshit."

Frank's eyebrows rise. "The Henderson girl?"

"Emma saw right through me. Told me I'm no different than everyone else who decides what's best for her without asking." I grab my work gloves, needing something to do with my hands. "She's right."

"Of course she's right." Frank returns to the Ford. "Question is, what are you going to do about it?"

I don't answer because I don't know.

What I do know: Emma Henderson is stronger than I gave her credit for, braver than I understood, and smart enough to see through my protective martyr act to the fear underneath.

What I do know: I messed up. Badly. Tried to make choices for her that weren't mine to make, and hurt her in the process.

What I do know: she thought I was different, and I proved I wasn't.

The question Frank asked—what am I going to do about it—that's the one I don't have an answer for yet.

But standing in Miller's Garage with grease under my nails and Emma's disappointed face burned into my memory, I know one thing for certain:

I need to do better. Need to be the person Emma thought I was, the one who sees her and respects her and trusts her to make her own choices.

Even when those choices scare me.

Especially then.
