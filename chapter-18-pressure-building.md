# Chapter 18: Pressure Building

The Wildcats left town Friday morning, roaring out the same way they'd come in—loud, aggressive, leaving chaos behind. Sheriff Patterson couldn't prove they'd vandalized the school or robbed the gas station, but everyone knew. The Wildcats were long gone by the time Patterson had enough evidence.

What they left behind was fear. And the Clearwater Riders were paying for it.

I felt the shift immediately. Where before we'd been tolerated—acknowledged as different from trouble—now we were suspect. Sheriff Patterson parked his patrol car near Miller's Garage during the day, watching. Business owners grew nervous when Riders walked in. Parents warned daughters to stay away from anyone on a motorcycle, making no distinctions.

Frank noticed it too. "Mrs. Chen at the grocery store asked if I thought the Riders might be planning to leave Clearwater," he told me Friday afternoon while we worked on a transmission together. "Said it might be better for everyone if we found somewhere else to call home."

I dropped the wrench I was holding, the metallic clang loud in the quiet garage. "She wants us to leave? We didn't do anything!"

"I know." Frank's voice was calm but tired. "I told her we're not going anywhere. This is our home same as hers. But Danny, the damage is done. In most people's minds, bikers destroyed their school. Doesn't matter that it wasn't us."

The injustice of it burned in my chest. We'd kept our heads down, avoided confrontation, done everything right. And it didn't matter. We wore leather jackets. We rode motorcycles. That was enough to make us guilty.

"What about Emma?" I asked quietly.

Frank's expression softened. "What about her?"

"Her reputation was already suffering because of me. Now this—the whole town thinking bikers are criminals. She's going to pay for that too."

Frank didn't disagree because we both knew it was true. Emma Henderson dating Danny Russo was already controversial. Emma Henderson dating a biker when bikers had just destroyed school property? That was something else entirely.

I found out how bad it was Saturday evening when Emma called the garage.

Frank handed me the phone, his expression grim. Emma's voice was steady, but I could hear the strain beneath it.

"My father knows about the vandalism," she said. "He heard the Riders were questioned."

"We didn't do it, Emma. We were at the clubhouse. Patterson verified—"

"I know you didn't do it," Emma interrupted, fierce. "I know the difference. But my father doesn't care."

My stomach dropped. "What did he say?"

Emma was quiet for a moment. "He forbid me from seeing you."

The words hit like a physical blow. I'd expected it—of course I had—but hearing it still hurt.

"Emma—"

"He said he won't have his daughter associated with criminals. That's the word he used. Criminals." Her voice broke slightly on the last word. "My mother agrees with him. She's been crying since yesterday, convinced I'm throwing my life away."

I leaned against Frank's desk, my free hand gripping the edge tight enough to hurt. This was what I'd feared from the beginning—Emma paying the price for my world, her family turning against her because she'd chosen me.

"Maybe they're right," I said quietly.

"Don't." Emma's voice was sharp. "Don't you dare start that again. You didn't vandalize the school. You didn't rob anyone. You're not a criminal, and I'm not going to let my father's fear decide my life."

"But your reputation—"

"Is already damaged," Emma said bluntly. "That happened the moment I kissed you at the fair. I chose that, Danny. I'm still choosing it."

"Even if it costs you your family?"

The silence stretched between us, heavy with everything we weren't saying. Finally, Emma spoke, and her voice was smaller, more vulnerable than I'd ever heard it.

"I'm hoping it won't cost me that. I'm hoping they'll see reason eventually. But if they don't..." She took a shaky breath. "I'm still choosing you."

The weight of that settled on my chest, making it hard to breathe. Emma was brave—braver than I'd ever be—standing up to her parents, defending me against their judgment. But bravery didn't make the cost any less real.

"I love you," I said, the words escaping before I could stop them.

Emma's breath caught. "What?"

"I love you," I repeated, meaning it with everything in me. "And I don't want to be the reason you lose everything that matters."

"You're not making me lose anything," Emma said firmly. "They're choosing fear over trust. That's not on you."

But it felt like it was on me. It felt like every bad thing happening to Emma traced back to the moment she'd decided a boy in a leather jacket was worth taking a chance on.

Sunday, I learned about Betty.

Tommy stopped by my apartment that afternoon, his expression careful.

"Saw Emma at church this morning," he said. "She looked tired."

"Her parents forbid her from seeing me," I said. "Found out yesterday."

Tommy nodded. "Betty wasn't sitting with her. Usually they sit together, right? Today Betty was three pews back with her fiancé's family."

My hands tightened on the Coke bottle. "Betty stopped talking to her?"

"Looked like it. Emma sat with her parents, and afterward Betty walked right past her without saying hello." Tommy's expression was sympathetic. "Sorry, man."

Betty Carlson, Emma's best friend since grade school. Now even Betty was pulling away, choosing social safety over friendship with the girl dating a biker.

I thought about Emma sitting in church, surrounded by people she'd known her whole life, isolated because she'd chosen me. The image made my chest ache.

"It's getting worse," I said quietly.

"Yeah," Tommy agreed. "Town's spooked. And Emma's paying for being associated with you."

He said it matter-of-factly, not cruel but honest. And the honesty hurt worse than any accusation could have.

Monday, I heard about the customers.

Frank told me while we were closing up the garage for the day. "Henderson's lost more business. Mrs. Morrison isn't the only one taking her purchases elsewhere. Word is at least five regular customers have stopped shopping there."

I set down the tool I was holding very carefully, afraid if I didn't I'd throw it. "Because of Emma dating me."

"Because people are scared and angry and looking for someone to blame," Frank corrected. "Emma's an easy target—visible, defiant, dating one of us. It's not fair, but fair doesn't matter much when people are feeling righteous."

Five customers. In a town the size of Clearwater, that was significant. Henderson General Store wasn't a big operation—they survived on regular customers, on relationships built over years. Losing five families meant losing real income, meant Robert Henderson watching his business suffer because his daughter had chosen a boy in a leather jacket.

"I need to end this," I said.

Frank looked at me sharply. "End what?"

"This. Me and Emma. I can't keep watching her lose everything."

"That Emma's choice to make," Frank said, his voice carrying warning.

"Is it?" I turned to face him. "She's seventeen, Frank. She doesn't understand the full cost yet. But I do. I'm watching her pay it in real time—her parents angry, her best friend gone, customers punishing her family, the whole town judging her. How is that fair to her?"

"Life's not fair," Frank said bluntly. "But taking away Emma's choice because you're scared? That's not protecting her. That's deciding she can't handle the consequences of her own decisions."

"Maybe she's not!" The words came out harsh, edged with frustration and fear. "Maybe I'm not worth what she's going through. Maybe everyone's right and I should have stayed away from her from the beginning."

Frank was quiet for a long moment, studying me with those eyes that saw too much. "You know what I think?" he finally said. "I think you're looking for an excuse to run because you're scared of how much you love her and how much loving her costs."

The accusation hit close enough to hurt. "That's not—"

"Yes, it is," Frank interrupted. "You love Emma. She loves you. And love is hard and messy and sometimes it costs more than you want to pay. But walking away because you're scared? That's cowardice dressed up as nobility."

He grabbed his jacket from the hook by the door. "Emma's made her choice. Question is: are you brave enough to let her keep it? Or are you going to prove her parents right by giving up the moment things get hard?"

He left me standing in the garage with those words echoing in my head and the weight of Emma's choice pressing against my chest.

Tuesday's delivery to Henderson's was the hardest yet.

Robert Henderson met me at the loading dock, his expression colder than I'd ever seen it. Margaret stood in the store's back doorway, her eyes red from crying, watching like she expected me to do something terrible.

"Delivery," I said, keeping my voice neutral.

Robert signed the invoice without speaking, his pen strokes angry. I unloaded the boxes in silence, hyperaware of Margaret's tearful stare, of Robert's rigid anger, of the complete absence of Emma.

When I finished, Robert finally spoke. "My daughter believes you're a good person."

I looked at him, surprised.

"I don't know if she's right," Robert continued, his voice hard. "But I do know that since you've been in her life, she's lost friends, my business is suffering, and her reputation is damaged possibly beyond repair. That's what you've brought to her, Mr. Russo. Regardless of your intentions."

The words cut deep because they were true. Everything Robert said was true—Emma had lost Betty, the store had lost customers, her reputation had suffered. All because of me.

"I never wanted to hurt her," I said quietly.

"And yet here we are." Robert's expression didn't soften. "Stay away from my daughter. Let her rebuild what you've cost her."

He walked back into the store without waiting for my response, leaving me standing on the loading dock with the summer sun beating down and the truth crushing my chest.

I'd tried so hard not to hurt Emma. But trying didn't matter when the outcome was the same—she was suffering, isolated, paying the price for choosing me.

I drove back to Miller's Garage with Robert's words ringing in my ears and a decision crystallizing.

Frank was right that I was scared. But sometimes fear was justified. Sometimes loving someone meant letting them go before you destroyed everything they had.

Emma deserved better than a boy whose world cost her friends, family approval, and her place in the community she'd known her whole life.

She deserved better than me.

The only way to give her that was to walk away before I cost her anything else.
