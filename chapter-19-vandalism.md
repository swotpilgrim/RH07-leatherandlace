# Chapter 19: Vandalism

Frank's call woke me at dawn Wednesday.

I fumbled for the phone. "Hello?"

"Danny." Frank's voice was tight. "Henderson General Store was vandalized last night."

I sat up, wide awake. "What?"

"Spray paint. 'BIKE TRASH' across the front wall. Robert found it this morning." Frank paused. "He's convinced the Riders did it."

My stomach dropped. "We didn't—"

"I know we didn't. Everyone was accounted for. But that won't matter to Robert or half the town."

I was already pulling on jeans. "I'm going over there."

"Danny, I don't think that's a good idea—"

"I have to see it."

I hung up before Frank could argue and kicked my motorcycle to life, roaring through Clearwater's empty streets toward Main.

I saw the crowd before I saw the store.

A dozen people stood on the sidewalk in front of Henderson General Store, staring. I pulled to the curb half a block away, heart pounding.

Red spray paint. Huge letters. BIKE TRASH sprawled across the white wall in angry, dripping lines. Meant to hurt.

Sheriff Patterson's patrol car sat in front. He stood talking to Robert Henderson, notebook in hand. Margaret stood nearby, her face pale, one hand covering her mouth.

I got off my bike and started walking toward them. The crowd noticed immediately—stares, whispers, people stepping back. I kept my eyes on the store.

"That's one of them," someone muttered.

"Has some nerve showing up here."

The words hit like fists, but I kept walking. Sheriff Patterson looked up and saw me. His expression hardened.

"Danny Russo," he said, his voice carrying that cop tone that meant I should be very careful. "I need to ask where you were last night between midnight and four a.m."

"At my apartment," I said, stopping where I was. "Sleeping."

"Anyone who can verify that?"

"No. I live alone." I looked past Patterson to Robert Henderson. "Mr. Henderson, I didn't do this. None of the Riders did this."

Robert's expression was cold, harder than I'd ever seen it. "You'll forgive me if I don't believe you, Mr. Russo. This message—" he gestured at the spray-painted words "—makes it very clear what whoever did this thinks of my family. And everyone knows my daughter has been associating with you and your club."

"We didn't do this," I repeated, forcing my voice to stay level. "Frank can account for where every Rider was last night. We were nowhere near here."

"Convenient," Robert said bitterly. "Tell me, do you have any idea what this costs me? What it costs my family? My business? My daughter?"

Margaret made a small sound, still standing with her hand over her mouth, tears streaming down her face. The sight of her crying hit me harder than any accusation.

"Mr. Henderson, I swear—"

"Get away from my store," Robert interrupted, his voice shaking with barely controlled rage. "Get away from my family. Haven't you done enough damage?"

"Robert," Sheriff Patterson said quietly, a warning.

But Robert wasn't listening. "Look at this!" He gestured at the spray paint, at the gathered crowd, at his crying wife. "This is what comes from my daughter associating with people like you. Vandalism. Public humiliation. Our store marked as trash by your kind."

"They're not my kind," I said, frustration breaking through my control. "The Riders didn't do this. Probably the Wildcats came back, or someone local trying to send you a message about Emma and me. But it wasn't us."

"It doesn't matter if it was you specifically," Robert shot back. "This is your world, Danny. Violence, vandalism, trouble. This is what you brought into my daughter's life. Into my family."

I had no defense because part of what he said was true. This was a consequence of my world touching Emma's. Someone had done this to punish the Hendersons, to mark them as tainted by association with me.

The back door of the store opened and Emma appeared.

She looked exhausted. Her eyes were red from crying. But when she saw me, something shifted in her expression—relief mixed with worry.

"Danny," she said, stepping toward me.

"Emma, get back inside," Robert ordered.

Emma ignored him, crossing the sidewalk to where I stood. Patterson moved slightly, positioning himself between us and Robert like he expected violence.

"I know you didn't do this," Emma said quietly, her eyes on mine.

"I know you know," I said, my throat tight. "But it doesn't matter, does it?"

Emma's eyes filled with tears. "It matters to me."

"Emma!" Robert's voice was sharp. "Inside. Now. I won't have you speaking to him."

Emma glanced at her father, and I saw the struggle on her face—the desire to defy him, to stand with me, warring against the pain of watching her parents suffer.

"You should go inside," I said quietly. "Your mom needs you."

Emma's hands clenched into fists at her sides. "This isn't fair."

"I know," I said. "But go inside anyway."

For a moment I thought she'd refuse. Then Margaret made another small sobbing sound, and Emma's expression crumpled. She looked at me one more time, something desperate in her eyes, before turning and walking back to her mother.

Margaret wrapped her arms around Emma, still crying, and they disappeared into the store together.

Robert stood watching me, his expression a mixture of anger and pain. "Stay away from my daughter," he said, quieter now but no less firm. "Please. Just stay away."

He followed his family inside without waiting for my response.

Sheriff Patterson cleared his throat. "You got anyone besides Frank who can verify where you were last night?"

"No," I admitted.

Patterson sighed. "I believe you, Danny. For what it's worth. This doesn't match the Riders' pattern, and Frank already called me first thing this morning with every member's whereabouts." He gestured at the spray paint. "This looks like angry locals or maybe the Wildcats doubling back. But believing you and proving it are different things."

"I know."

"And in the meantime, people will believe what they want to believe." Patterson's expression was sympathetic. "Might want to keep your head down for a while. Let things cool off."

I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.

Patterson went back to his patrol car, leaving me standing on the sidewalk staring at that spray-painted message. BIKE TRASH. Red and angry and dripping down the white wall of Emma's family store.

The crowd still watched, muttering among themselves. I caught fragments of conversation.

"Serves them right for letting her date that boy."

"Poor Margaret. So humiliating."

"Someone had to send a message."

That last one caught my attention. Someone had to send a message. Not the Riders, but someone local. Someone who thought the Hendersons needed to be punished for Emma's choice, who thought marking their business with hateful words would somehow fix what they saw as wrong.

And they were right in a way—not right to vandalize, not right to attack the Hendersons. But right that Emma's choice to be with me had cost her family. Cost them customers, cost them reputation, cost them peace. And now cost them this: public humiliation, their store marked as trash for everyone to see.

I stood there until the crowd started dispersing, until Patterson finished his report and drove away, until I was alone with the spray paint and the morning sun and the weight of everything crushing my chest.

This was my fault.

Not the actual spray paint—I hadn't done that, the Riders hadn't done that. But the reason behind it, the target on the Hendersons' backs, Emma's family suffering—that was all because of me.

Because Emma had chosen me, and I'd been selfish enough to let her.

I climbed on my motorcycle and rode back to my apartment, Robert's words ringing in my ears. Haven't you done enough damage? The answer was clear: yes. I'd done more than enough.

---

I called Frank from my apartment.

"Saw the store," I said when he answered.

"I figured you would." Frank's voice was careful. "You okay?"

"No." I sat on my couch, staring at the wall. "Robert Henderson is right, Frank. This is my fault."

"Danny—"

"Not the spray paint. I know we didn't do that. But the reason someone did it? That's on me. Emma's family is being punished because she's with me."

Frank was quiet for a moment. "What are you going to do?"

"What I should have done from the beginning," I said, the words tasting like ash. "I'm going to end this before I cost her anything else."

"Emma won't want that."

"Emma doesn't get to want that," I said, harder than I intended. "She's seventeen and she thinks love is enough. But I'm watching her lose everything—her friends, her family's business, her reputation, now this. Someone vandalized her family's store, Frank. Spray-painted it for the whole town to see. Because of me."

"Because of small-minded people who can't see past leather jackets," Frank corrected.

"Doesn't matter why," I said. "Matters that it happened. Matters that as long as Emma's with me, it'll keep happening. The town will keep punishing her, her family will keep suffering, and I'll keep watching her pay for my world."

Frank sighed. "You're going to break her heart."

"Better a broken heart than a destroyed life," I said quietly.

I hung up before Frank could argue, before he could point out the flaws in my logic or challenge my decision. I knew what I had to do. Had known since I saw Margaret Henderson crying, since I heard Robert's voice shaking with rage, since I stood in front of that spray-painted message and understood exactly what my presence in Emma's life cost.

I loved her. God, I loved her more than I'd thought possible to love anyone.

And because I loved her, I had to let her go.

That night, I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, making plans. Tomorrow I'd tell Frank I was done with Henderson deliveries. I'd avoid Main Street, avoid anywhere I might run into Emma. I'd make it clear through absence that we were over.

And when Emma came looking for me—because she would, I knew she would—I'd tell her the truth: that I couldn't watch her lose everything, that loving her didn't give me the right to destroy her life, that she deserved better than a boy whose world cost her family their peace.

I'd tell her all of it, and then I'd walk away.

The decision settled over me like a stone, heavy and cold and absolutely certain.

It was the right thing to do.

The only thing to do.

Even if it felt like dying.
