# Chapter 7: Falling Without Permission

I'm lying to myself, and I'm done pretending otherwise.

Thursday night finds me alone in my apartment, lying on my bed fully clothed, staring at the water stain on the ceiling while traffic noise filters up from Railroad Street. The dry cleaner downstairs is quiet for once—Sal closes early on Thursdays—and the silence makes thinking too easy.

I'm falling for Emma Henderson.

No. That's not accurate.

I've already fallen. Past tense. Done deal. Somewhere between her genuine smile and her intelligent questions and the way she looked at my Harley like it was beautiful, somewhere between coffee in the back room and learning about her trapped dreams, somewhere between "I'll see you next Thursday" becoming the best promise in my week—somewhere in all of that, I fell.

I didn't mean to. Didn't want to. Definitely didn't ask for it.

But Emma Henderson has gotten under my skin, into my thoughts, and I can't seem to get her out.

The realization sits in my chest like a stone, heavy and undeniable.

This is a disaster.

I know how this story goes. I've seen it play out in Clearwater a dozen times—good girl falls for bad boy, town gossip starts, her family intervenes, and it ends with her reputation in tatters and him blamed for corrupting her.

Emma has a future. Respectable family, good reputation, a store she could run if they'd let her. She has opportunities, potential, a life that doesn't include guys who work at garages and live in apartments above dry cleaners.

I have grease under my fingernails that won't ever fully come out, a leather jacket that makes people cross the street, and a reputation I can't shake. I have the Riders and the garage and the road, which is a good life but not the kind that intersects with Emma Henderson's world.

Good girls and bad boys don't get happy endings in towns like Clearwater. That's just reality.

But telling myself that doesn't make my chest hurt less when I think about her smile. Doesn't make me want her any less. Doesn't change the fact that Thursday mornings have become the highlight of my week, that I polish my bike more than necessary hoping she'll see it, that I lie awake at night imagining what it would feel like to have her arms around my waist while we ride into the sunset like some Hollywood ending.

I check the clock. Eleven-thirty.

I should sleep. Should close my eyes and force my brain to shut down and wake up tomorrow ready to work and stop thinking about impossible things.

Instead I grab my jacket and head downstairs.

Miller's Garage is dark when I arrive, my key turning in the lock with a familiar click. I flip on the overhead lights in bay two—just enough to see by without advertising my presence to the whole street—and survey my options.

Jake's Harley is here, waiting for a carburetor rebuild I've been putting off. Perfect. Complicated enough to require focus, familiar enough that my hands know what to do even when my brain is elsewhere.

I grab my tools and get to work.

There's a meditation in engine work, a peace in the mechanical logic of parts fitting together in precise ways. You can't lie to an engine. Either it works or it fails.

I wish human relationships were that straightforward.

My hands work steadily—removing the carburetor, disassembling it, cleaning each component. The familiar smell of gasoline and metal cleaner grounds me, keeps my thoughts from spiraling too far.

But Emma keeps slipping through anyway.

The way she looked at my bike, touching the chrome so carefully. The longing in her voice when she asked what it's like to ride away from everything. The vulnerability when she admitted she wanted to matter for something besides who she marries.

She sees me. Really sees me—not the leather jacket or the reputation or the assumptions everyone else makes. She sees Danny, the guy who likes fixing things because they make sense, who rides because it's freedom, who wants to be more than what Clearwater decides he is.

And God help me, I see her too. See Emma trapped in expectations and desperate to break free, full of ideas nobody will listen to, smart and capable and wasted on being appropriate.

We're so different. But we're the same in all the ways that matter.

That's what makes this so dangerous.

I could protect her by staying away. Should protect her. But every Thursday she keeps the conversation going, looks at me like I'm worth her time. And I'm selfish enough to keep showing up, keep falling deeper into something that can only end badly.

The clock shows two-fifteen when I finish. My hands are black with grease, my back aches, and my thoughts are no clearer than when I started.

I move to the sink, scrubbing with industrial soap. In the mirror above the sink, I look tired. Older than nineteen. Like a guy fighting a battle he knows he's going to lose.

Maybe I should just accept it. Accept that I've fallen for Emma Henderson, that it's going to hurt, that there's no good ending here. Maybe I should take whatever time we have—these Thursday mornings, these conversations, this impossible connection—and let the future take care of itself.

Or maybe I should walk away now, before either of us gets hurt worse.

I don't know. I don't have any answers.

What I have is grease under my fingernails and an ache in my chest and the memory of Emma saying my name like it matters.

I return to Jake's bike, starting on the reassembly. My hands know the pattern—carburetor back in place, fuel line connected, adjustments with practiced precision. The work is soothing, demanding enough to keep part of my brain occupied.

But not enough to stop me thinking about her.

Dawn is breaking when Frank arrives, morning light filtering through the garage windows in shades of grey and gold. I hear his bike before I see him, that distinctive rumble of his '52 Panhead. The garage door opens and Frank walks in, stopping short when he sees me.

"How long have you been here?"

"Couple hours." I don't look up from the final adjustments on Jake's carburetor. "Couldn't sleep."

Frank moves closer, studying me with those sharp eyes that miss nothing. He doesn't ask what's wrong—he already knows, has probably known since the first Thursday I came back from Henderson's with that look on my face.

"You finished Jake's rebuild."

"Yeah. Should run smooth now."

"Danny." Frank's voice is gentle but firm. "Look at me."

I straighten, meeting his gaze. Whatever he sees in my face makes him nod slowly, like I've confirmed something.

"You're in deep with the Henderson girl."

It's not a question.

"Yeah."

"She feel the same?"

"I don't know." The honesty tastes bitter. "Maybe. I think so. But it doesn't matter, does it? Her world and my world don't mix. Everyone knows that. Her parents would lose their minds, the whole town would talk, and Emma would pay the price for being seen with me."

"So you're planning to walk away? Protect her from yourself?"

"I'm planning to..." I trail off, because I don't have a plan. Just fear and want warring in my chest. "I'm planning to not ruin her life."

Frank leans against the workbench, arms crossed. "Can I tell you something?"

"Can I stop you?"

A ghost of a smile crosses his face. "No. Here it is: whatever you're fighting right now—whether to run from this thing with Emma or run toward it—you need to make a decision. Because standing still, torturing yourself at two in the morning in my garage, that's not protecting anyone. That's just letting fear make your choices for you."

"Fear's a pretty good guide when you're about to do something stupid."

"Or fear's what keeps you from ever having anything worth having." Frank straightens. "I'm not saying chase the Henderson girl if it's going to hurt her. I'm saying figure out what you actually want and what she actually wants, and stop assuming you know better than she does what's good for her. That's not protection, kid. That's control disguised as nobility."

His words hit hard, cutting through my self-justification.

"What if I want her and it costs her everything? What if the town turns on her because of me?"

"Then she gets to decide if you're worth it. Not you deciding for her." Frank moves toward his office. "Go home, Danny. Get some sleep. And stop trying to be the hero of a story where maybe you're actually just a guy falling for a girl who might be falling back."

He disappears into the office, leaving me alone with Jake's rebuilt Harley and thoughts that won't settle.

Maybe you're actually just a guy falling for a girl who might be falling back.

Am I? Is that all this is—not some doomed tragedy where I have to sacrifice my feelings to protect her, but just two people who like each other trying to figure out if there's a way to make it work?

The simplicity of that idea is almost harder to accept than the tragedy.

I clean up my workspace, putting tools away with automatic precision. The sun's fully up now, Clearwater waking around me—cars starting, people heading to work, the town beginning another day of judgment and expectation and rigid dividing lines.

Somewhere on Main Street, Emma's probably opening Henderson's for business, maybe thinking about our conversation in the back room, maybe not thinking about me at all.

I want to believe she's thinking about me. Want to believe Thursday mornings matter to her like they matter to me. Want to believe that what I saw in her eyes when she looked at my bike—that longing, that understanding—means she's feeling what I'm feeling.

But wanting and knowing are different things.

I lock up the garage and head for my apartment, exhaustion finally catching up to me. Sleep comes quickly once I hit the bed, dreamless and heavy.

When I wake Thursday afternoon, the sun slanting through my window at a sharp angle, I'm no closer to answers.

I've fallen for Emma Henderson. That's the truth I can't deny anymore.

What I do with that truth—whether I run from it or toward it, whether I trust Emma to make her own choices or keep trying to protect her from mine—that's the question I still can't answer.

But Frank's right about one thing: standing still isn't an option. Fear making my choices isn't nobility.

It's just cowardice with a prettier name.

And whatever else I am, whatever else Clearwater thinks I am, I've never been a coward about the things that actually matter.

Maybe it's time to stop starting now.
