# Chapter 10: Drawing Lines That Don't Hold

This time, I mean it.

Real distance. Professional boundaries. Thursday deliveries as pure business transaction—unload boxes, get signature, leave. No lingering, no conversations, no allowing myself to hope for something that only causes Emma problems.

I've learned my lesson. Emma was right to call me out, and the answer isn't trying to protect her by making decisions for her. The answer is removing myself from the equation entirely. If I'm not around to cause gossip, there's no gossip. If I'm not talking to Emma, there's nothing for her mother to worry about. Simple.

Thursday morning, I time the delivery for nine o'clock—when Henderson's has been open long enough that Robert will definitely be there, but early enough that Emma might not be on the floor yet. She helps with inventory on Thursday mornings sometimes, works in the back room on the ledgers. I might get lucky and avoid her entirely.

I pull up to the loading dock, and through the store window I can see Robert at the counter with a customer. No sign of Emma. The relief and disappointment hit simultaneously, a one-two punch I don't examine too closely.

The delivery goes fast. I work efficiently, methodically, my focus entirely on the boxes and the invoice. Robert appears to sign off, his greeting as curt as always.

"Russo."

"Mr. Henderson."

He checks the boxes against the invoice, signs with practiced efficiency, and hands back my copy. The whole interaction takes maybe two minutes. Professional. Distant. Exactly what I wanted.

I climb back in the truck and drive away, not letting myself look back.

Next Thursday, same routine. Time the delivery for nine, keep it strictly business, avoid conversation. Robert signs the invoice with barely a word. I catch myself scanning the store interior for a flash of yellow dress or brown hair pulled back in a ponytail, and force my eyes back to the paperwork.

She's not there. Or she's there but staying away. Either way, the result is the same—no conversation, no connection, no Emma.

This is good. This is what needs to happen.

The hollowness in my chest disagrees, but I ignore it.

By the third Thursday of maintained distance, the Riders have noticed.

"You're doing that thing again," Tommy observes at the clubhouse, dealing cards for poker we're not really playing.

"What thing?"

"That brooding, tortured thing. Like you're carrying the weight of the world and won't let anyone help."

"I'm fine."

"You're miserable," Russ corrects. "And you've been miserable for three weeks. Ever since you stopped talking about Henderson's deliveries."

I don't respond. There's nothing to say that won't lead to a conversation I don't want to have.

Frank watches from his spot near the window, silent but observant. I can feel his attention like a physical weight, his judgment of my choices hanging unspoken between us.

The poker game continues, but my heart's not in it. Nothing feels right lately—not work, not riding, not the clubhouse. Everything's painted in shades of grey, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm doing something wrong while doing everything right.

Thursday four, Emma isn't at the store again. Or maybe she is, somewhere in the back, choosing not to appear. Robert signs the invoice with his usual efficiency, and I leave with the hollow feeling growing larger.

I catch myself looking for her yellow sundress despite my best intentions. Catch myself hoping she'll appear in the doorway with that crease between her eyebrows and a question I can't avoid answering. Catch myself wanting what I'm deliberately avoiding.

The contradiction is exhausting.

Frank finally corners me Friday afternoon when I'm working late on a transmission rebuild.

"We need to talk."

I don't look up from the transmission. "I'm busy."

"So am I. We're talking anyway." Frank leans against the workbench, arms crossed. "This noble suffering act—how's it working for you?"

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Danny." His voice is patient but firm. "You've been walking around here for a month looking like someone died. You're avoiding Henderson's deliveries like they're poison, timing them so you won't run into Emma. You're miserable, and you're pretending you're not."

"I'm doing the right thing."

"Are you?" Frank's tone sharpens. "Or are you just protecting yourself?"

I set down my wrench, meeting his gaze. "I'm protecting Emma. From the gossip, from her mother's disapproval, from the cost of being seen with me. That's what you told me to do—respect her choices. Well, she's better off not having to make a choice at all."

"That's not what I told you." Frank straightens. "I told you to let her decide what she's willing to risk, not to make that decision for her by disappearing."

"Same result, different method."

"Is it?" Frank moves closer, his expression serious. "Because from where I'm standing, you're still controlling her choices. Just doing it by absence instead of presence. You're still deciding what Emma can and can't handle, still treating her like she needs protecting instead of respecting."

The words hit harder than they should, echoing Emma's accusation from weeks ago.

"I'm keeping her safe," I insist, but it sounds hollow even to my ears.

"From what? From gossip? From her mother's opinion? Or from the possibility that she might choose you and you might not be worthy of that choice?" Frank's gaze is unflinching. "You're so focused on protecting Emma from pain that you're not seeing the pain you're causing by pulling away. You think absence is kindness, but it's just another form of rejection."

"She's better off without me in her life."

"Did she tell you that?"

I don't answer.

"Did Emma ever say she wanted you to back off? To stop talking to her? To treat her like a stranger?" Frank presses. "Or did you decide that for her?"

"She called me out for making decisions for her," I admit. "Told me I was just like everyone else who decides what's best for her without asking. Said she thought I was different."

"And your response was to prove her right by deciding you should disappear from her life? By once again making a choice about her without including her?" Frank shakes his head. "That's not respecting her, Danny. That's just being a coward with better excuses."

The accusation stings, sharp and accurate.

"What am I supposed to do?" The frustration bleeds through, raw and real. "Every time I'm around her, she pays a price. Her mother watches her, the town talks, her reputation suffers. How is staying away not the right answer?"

"Maybe it is the right answer," Frank concedes. "But it should be Emma's answer, not yours. You're so busy protecting her from herself that you've forgotten she's a person with agency and intelligence and the right to choose her own hard paths."

"I'm trying to do right by her."

"By hiding? By avoiding her? By treating Thursday deliveries like a mission to complete as fast as possible?" Frank's voice softens slightly. "Danny, I've watched you fall for this girl over the past months. Watched you light up talking about her, watched you care about her in ways you haven't cared about anyone. And now I'm watching you tear yourself apart trying to be noble, when really you're just scared."

"Of course I'm scared. I'm scared of hurting her."

"No." Frank's response is immediate. "You're scared of trying and failing. Scared of letting her choose you and not being enough. Scared of being vulnerable and getting hurt. So you're calling it protection and walking away before she can reject you."

The truth of it lands like a blow.

"And here's the thing," Frank continues. "You're hurting her anyway. By disappearing without explanation, by treating her like she can't handle hard conversations, by taking away her choice. You're causing the exact pain you're trying to prevent, just with different packaging."

I slump against the workbench, the weight of his words pressing down.

"I don't know what to do."

"Talk to her. Honestly, vulnerably, without making decisions for her. Tell her what you're afraid of. Ask her what she wants. Then trust her answer, whatever it is." Frank moves toward the office, then pauses. "And stop confusing fear with nobility. They're not the same thing, no matter how much you want them to be."

He leaves me alone in the garage, fluorescent lights humming overhead, transmission in pieces on the bench, and my thoughts in matching disarray.

Thursday five arrives like a reckoning.

I drive to Henderson's at nine o'clock, same as the past month. Unload the boxes, wheel them to the storeroom, wait for Robert to appear and sign the invoice.

He does, efficient as always. I take my copy, head for the truck.

And stop.

Emma's not here. Hasn't been here for any of the past four deliveries. Maybe she's avoiding me the same way I'm avoiding her. Maybe she finally took the hint that I don't want to talk to her. Maybe she's moved on, accepted that whatever was developing between us isn't worth pursuing.

This is what I wanted. Emma safe, her reputation intact, no more gossip or disapproving looks or costs for being friendly with me.

So why does it feel like I've lost something irreplaceable?

I sit in the truck cab, hands on the wheel, staring at Henderson's storefront through the windshield.

Frank's right. I'm not being noble. I'm being a coward.

I pulled away not to protect Emma, but to protect myself from the terrifying possibility that she might choose me and I might not be enough. From the vulnerability of being chosen and still causing her pain. From the risk of trying and failing and having to live with that failure.

It was easier to make the choice for her. Easier to control the outcome by disappearing. Easier to call it protection than to call it fear.

But Emma saw through it immediately. Saw that I was treating her like everyone else does—making decisions about her life without trusting her strength or intelligence or right to choose her own path.

And my response? To prove her completely right by disappearing without a word.

The hollowness in my chest isn't righteousness or the price of doing the right thing.

It's loss. It's cowardice. It's the specific kind of pain that comes from walking away from something real because you're too scared to find out if it could work.

I start the truck and drive back to Miller's Garage, Frank's words echoing in my head: *Stop confusing fear with nobility. They're not the same thing.*

No, they're not.

And it's time I stopped pretending otherwise.
