# Chapter 28: Family Reckoning

The picnic wound down as evening approached. Families packed up blankets and leftover food, kids exhausted from running in the summer heat. The Riders had left an hour ago, Frank giving me a nod that said *Handle your business* before riding off with Tommy and the others.

Emma and I sat under an oak tree at the edge of the park, far enough from her parents for privacy but close enough to see them packing up. Betty and Sarah had left too, promising Emma they'd call tomorrow. The reconciliations were tentative but real.

"Are you okay?" I asked, my thumb tracing circles on the back of Emma's hand.

"I don't know," she admitted. "I just publicly confronted my parents and half the town. I'm either okay or I've lost my mind."

"You were incredible," I said. "Brave. Everything you said—about me, about them, about making your own choices. You were right about all of it."

Emma leaned against me, her head on my shoulder. "I've been thinking about it for two weeks. What I'd say if I got the chance. How I'd make them see." She paused. "I didn't expect the chance to come at the town picnic in front of everyone."

"Glad it did," I said. "Saved me from figuring out how to apologize without sounding like an idiot."

Emma laughed softly. "You managed okay. 'I love you and I'm sorry' is a pretty good start."

"Just a start?" I turned to look at her.

"Well, you did break my heart," Emma said, but her tone was gentle. "It'll take more than one apology."

"I know." I took a breath. "Emma, I was wrong. About everything. I thought I was protecting you by walking away, but really I was just protecting myself from watching you pay for loving me. And I was treating you like you couldn't make your own decisions, like you weren't strong enough to handle the consequences."

Emma listened quietly, her hand still in mine.

"You were right when you said I didn't trust you," I continued. "I didn't. I saw you losing Betty and customers and your family's approval, and I couldn't handle it. Couldn't handle being the reason you were hurting. So I made the choice for you. Decided you'd be better off without me. And that was—"

"Cowardice," Emma finished. "Betty called it that. So did you, just now."

"Yeah." The admission hurt but it was true. "I was scared. Of how much I loved you. Of how much loving me cost you. Of not being worth that cost. So I ran. And I hurt you worse than any of the gossip ever could have."

Emma was quiet for a moment. "You did hurt me. Badly. Not because you walked away—I could have forgiven that if you'd just talked to me first. But you didn't trust me to be part of the decision. You just decided for me, like everyone else in this town."

"I know," I said quietly. "And I'm sorry. I can't take it back. Can't undo walking away or the two weeks we lost. But Emma, I promise you—if you give me another chance, I will never make decisions for you again. I'll trust you. Trust your strength. Trust that you know your own mind."

"What changed?" Emma asked. "Between two weeks ago and now?"

I thought about Betty coming to the garage. About Tommy's reports of Emma looking miserable. About Frank's patient wisdom. About watching Emma across the park today and knowing I'd give anything to fix what I'd broken.

"Betty came to see me," I said. "Told me I was an idiot. That you were miserable. That I'd hurt you by not trusting you." I paused. "And then today, watching you stand up in front of the whole town and publicly choose me—knowing what that cost, what it might still cost—I realized you were never the one who needed protecting. You're the strongest person I know, Emma. Braver than I'll ever be."

Emma's eyes were wet. "I missed you so much."

"I missed you too." My voice broke. "Every day. Every night. The garage, the apartment, everywhere I went I just—I missed you. And I knew I'd screwed up but I didn't know how to fix it."

"You're fixing it now," Emma said. She lifted her head from my shoulder to look at me. "By being honest. By trusting me. By letting me make this choice."

Robert Henderson approached, his steps slow like he was walking to something he didn't want to face. Emma and I stood, still holding hands.

"Emma," Robert said. "We need to talk. As a family."

Emma nodded. "Okay. But Danny stays. He's part of this."

Robert's jaw tightened, but he didn't argue. Margaret joined us, looking tired and worried.

"What you said today," Robert started, then stopped. He seemed to be struggling with the words. "About us treating you like a child. About not trusting your decisions."

"I meant it," Emma said quietly. "I know you love me. I know you want what's best. But you can't keep deciding my life for me."

"You're seventeen," Margaret said. "Still in high school. You don't know—"

"Don't know what?" Emma challenged gently. "Don't know my own heart? Don't know what makes me happy? Mom, I've spent seventeen years watching you and Dad run a business, raise me, make decisions. You taught me to think critically. To judge character. To stand up for what I believe in. Now you have to trust that I learned those lessons."

Robert looked at me, his expression hard. "And you believe my daughter is making the right choice? Choosing you over her reputation, her family's business, her standing in this town?"

The question was a trap—either I agreed Emma was making the right choice and proved I was selfish, or I disagreed and proved I wasn't worth fighting for.

"I believe Emma is strong enough to make her own choices," I said carefully. "Right or wrong, they're hers to make. And I believe that if she's choosing me, the least I can do is spend every day trying to be worthy of that choice."

"That's not an answer," Robert said.

"Yes, it is," Emma interjected. "That's exactly the answer. Danny's not telling me what's right for me. He's trusting me to know. That's what I need—someone who sees me as capable of deciding my own life."

Margaret's expression softened slightly. "Sweetheart, we're not trying to control you. We're trying to protect you from getting hurt."

"I know," Emma said. "But you can't protect me from everything. And trying to makes me feel suffocated." She took a breath. "I need you to trust me. Trust that I can make mistakes and learn from them. Trust that I'm strong enough to handle consequences. Trust that even if you disagree with my choices, they're still mine to make."

The weight of that hung between them. Robert and Margaret exchanging that silent married-couple communication again.

"If we keep forbidding you from seeing him," Robert said slowly, "you'll just do it anyway. We'll lose you."

"Maybe," Emma admitted. "I don't want to lose you. But I won't lose myself either. Won't give up my own choices to keep everyone else comfortable."

Margaret wiped her eyes. "When did you get so grown up?"

"You raised me this way," Emma said gently. "Independent. Strong-willed. Thinking for myself. You just didn't expect me to use those qualities to make choices you disagreed with."

Robert sighed heavily. "I still don't like this. Don't like him—" He looked at me. "No offense."

"None taken," I said.

"But Emma's right." Robert's voice was reluctant. "We can't keep treating her like a child. If we do, we'll lose her. And that—" His voice caught. "That would be worse than whatever mistakes she might make."

"Danny isn't a mistake," Emma said firmly.

"Time will tell," Robert said. But his tone had shifted from absolute opposition to grudging acceptance. "But it's your choice to make. Your time to tell."

Emma's eyes filled with tears. "Thank you, Dad."

Robert nodded stiffly. Margaret stepped forward and pulled Emma into a hug. "I still worry," she whispered.

"I know, Mom," Emma said. "But trust me. Please?"

Margaret pulled back, looking at me over Emma's shoulder. "You'll take care of her?"

"I'll respect her," I corrected gently. "I'll trust her. I'll be there for her. But Emma doesn't need taking care of. She's strong enough to take care of herself."

Emma smiled through tears. "He's learning."

Margaret almost smiled. "He better be."

It wasn't perfect. Robert still looked uncomfortable. Margaret still looked worried. But it was something—acknowledgment that Emma's choice was hers to make, even if they didn't agree with it.

"We should go," Robert said. "It's getting late."

Emma looked at me, a question in her eyes.

"I'll see you tomorrow," I said. "At the store?"

"At the store," Emma agreed. She squeezed my hand one more time, then walked back to her parents.

I watched them pack up the last of their picnic supplies, watched Emma help her mother fold the blanket, watched Robert's stiff posture gradually relax.

It would take time. Maybe a lot of time. But Emma had made her stand, and her parents had listened. Not agreed, maybe. Not approved, definitely. But listened. Acknowledged. Began to accept.

That was enough for now.

And tomorrow, I'd keep proving I was worth the choice Emma had made.

One day at a time.

Together.
