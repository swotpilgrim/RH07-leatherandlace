# Chapter 22: Emma's Pain

Monday morning, Tommy came back from the Henderson delivery looking uncomfortable.

I was under a Chevy when I heard him pull the truck in. I didn't ask about the delivery—hadn't asked all week, hadn't let myself think about Emma.

Tommy didn't give me a choice.

"Emma looks bad, man. Really bad."

My hands stilled on the wrench. I didn't want to hear this. But Tommy kept talking.

"She was at the counter when I brought the delivery in. Barely said two words. Just signed the invoice and went back to work. She looked like she hasn't slept in days. Like she's just going through the motions. Robert seemed worried, kept watching her like he expected her to break."

The image hit me hard—Emma exhausted, Emma barely functioning, Emma broken. Because of me. Because I'd walked away.

"She'll be okay," I said, my voice rougher than I intended. "Give it time."

"Will she?" Tommy challenged. "Because it's been a week and she looks worse, not better. And you—" He gestured at me lying under a car in the middle of a workday I'd started at dawn. "You look like hell too."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine," Tommy said flatly. "Neither is Emma. And maybe—" He stopped himself.

"Maybe what?" I rolled out from under the Chevy to look at him.

Tommy met my eyes. "Maybe you made a mistake."

The words landed heavy in the space between us. I wanted to argue, to defend my decision, to explain that I'd done the right thing. But the words wouldn't come. Because seeing Tommy's expression—concern mixed with frustration mixed with something that looked like pity—made the certainty I'd been clinging to crack a little more.

"She'll be better off eventually," I said, but it sounded hollow even to me.

Tommy shook his head. "If you say so, man. But from where I'm standing, all you did was hurt both of you for nothing."

He left me lying on the garage floor with that truth hanging in the air.

Tuesday afternoon, someone cleared their throat behind me. I turned.

Betty Carlson stood in the garage doorway in a blue dress and heels, looking out of place among the tools and grease. Her expression was anger and determination.

"Betty." I set down my wrench, wiping my hands. "What are you—"

"You're an idiot," she interrupted. "A complete idiot."

I blinked. "What?"

"Emma." Betty stepped into the garage, heels clicking. "You broke up with her. And now she's miserable. Completely miserable."

"She'll—"

"Don't," Betty cut me off again. "Don't tell me she'll be fine or she'll get over it or whatever lie you're telling yourself. I've known Emma her whole life. I've seen her sad, seen her upset, seen her angry. I've never seen her like this."

The words hit like fists, each one landing harder than the last. "I didn't want to hurt her—"

"But you did," Betty said flatly. "You absolutely did. She's barely eating, barely sleeping. Just going through the motions at the store. Her parents are worried sick. And you know what the worst part is?"

I didn't answer because I couldn't speak past the guilt choking me.

"She believed in you," Betty continued, softer but no less cutting. "When everyone told her you'd break her heart, she defended you. Said you were different. Said you saw her as strong." Betty's eyes were wet. "And then you proved all of us right. You walked away when things got hard."

"I was trying to protect her," I managed.

"From what?" Betty challenged. "From gossip? From judgment? Those things were already happening. Walking away didn't protect her. It just made her face it alone and heartbroken."

Each word cut through my justifications. "The vandalism—"

"Wasn't your fault," Betty interrupted. "The Riders didn't do it, Emma knows that. But you're using it as an excuse to run."

"I'm not running away," I protested, but the words had no force behind them.

"Yes, you are," Betty said, her voice carrying absolute certainty. "And you know what makes it worse? I was wrong about you. I thought you were the kind of boy who'd hurt Emma because you didn't care. But you're worse than that. You're the kind who hurts her because you care too much and you're too scared to trust her with that."

The accuracy of the accusation stole my breath. "Betty—"

"I was wrong," she continued, tears streaming. "I told Emma you weren't worth the risk. I stopped being her friend because she chose you. And I was wrong. You were good for her. She was happy. And I threw away our friendship because I was scared and judgmental."

Betty wiped her eyes. "Now Emma doesn't have you and she doesn't have me and she's going through hell alone. You're an idiot. But I'm a bigger one. And Emma's paying for both of us being cowards."

The admission hung between us, raw. I wanted to argue, but what defense did I have? Everything Betty said was true.

"I don't know how to fix it," I said quietly.

"Yes, you do," Betty said, her voice gentler now. "You go to her. You apologize. You tell her she was right about everything. And you trust her enough to let her decide if she wants to give you another chance."

"And if she doesn't?" The question came out small, vulnerable.

"Then you live with that," Betty said simply. "But at least you'll have respected her enough to let her choose. Which is what you should have done from the beginning."

She turned to leave, then paused at the garage entrance. "For what it's worth, I think she'd forgive you. Emma has a bigger heart than this whole town deserves. But you need to ask. You need to trust her strength instead of treating her like she's fragile."

Betty walked away, leaving me standing in the garage with her words ringing in my ears and my defenses crumbling around me.

Frank appeared from the back office.

"She's right," he said, leaning against the doorframe. "About all of it."

I sank onto the stool, head in my hands. "I was trying to do the right thing."

"I know. But sometimes the right thing is trusting someone to make their own mistakes. Emma knew what she was choosing. She knew the cost. She chose you anyway."

"Because she's seventeen and doesn't understand—"

"No," Frank interrupted. "Because she's brave and knows her own mind. You're the one who doesn't understand that."

I looked up at him. "Everyone was punishing her because of me. Her family, the town, her best friend. The vandalism—"

"Was other people's choices," Frank said. "Other people's fear and prejudice and small-mindedness. Not yours. You didn't vandalize that store, Danny. You didn't drive customers away. You didn't make Betty stop being Emma's friend. Those were choices other people made."

"But if I hadn't been in her life—"

"Then she'd be safe and acceptable and completely trapped in the life everyone else decided for her," Frank finished. "Is that really what you want for her? To spend her life playing it safe, never choosing anything that might cost her, never fighting for what she actually wants?"

The question hit hard. "No. Of course not."

"Then why are you taking that choice away from her?" Frank's voice was gentle but relentless. "Why are you deciding she's not strong enough to handle loving you? Because that's what you did, Danny. You looked at everything Emma was willing to face for you and decided she didn't know her own mind."

I couldn't answer because he was right. Betty was right. Tommy was right. Even Emma had been right when she'd accused me of not trusting her.

"She said I'm just like everyone else in this town," I said quietly. "That I think I know better than her. That I don't trust her strength."

"Are you?" Frank asked. "Is she right about that?"

I thought about Emma's face when I'd told her I was ending it. The hurt, the anger, the devastation. The way she'd accused me of treating her like a child, of taking away her choice, of being exactly like everyone else who decided her life for her.

I'd thought I was protecting her.

But all I'd done was become another person who didn't trust Emma to know her own heart.

"Yeah," I admitted, the word heavy with regret. "She's right. I don't trust her. Or I didn't. I thought I was protecting her but really I was just—" I stopped, the truth too painful.

"Just protecting yourself," Frank finished quietly. "From watching her suffer. From the guilt of it. From having to sit with the knowledge that loving you costs her something."

He was right. God, he was right. I'd told myself I was being noble, being selfless, putting Emma first. But really I'd been protecting myself from the pain of watching her pay for choosing me. I'd walked away so I wouldn't have to keep seeing her hurt, keep hearing her parents' anger, keep knowing that my presence in her life made everything harder for her.

"I screwed up," I said.

"Yeah," Frank agreed. "You did. Question is: what are you going to do about it?"

I looked up at him. "What if she won't forgive me?"

"That's her choice to make," Frank said. "Not yours. You don't get to decide for her anymore, Danny. You gave up that right when you walked away. Now you either trust her enough to let her choose, or you don't. But you can't have it both ways—can't claim you love her while refusing to respect her strength."

The truth of it settled over me like a weight. I had to choose: keep hiding behind noble excuses, or face Emma and trust her to decide for herself. Trust her strength. Trust her judgment. Trust that she knew her own heart and her own limits better than I did.

"What if I'm not brave enough?" I asked quietly.

Frank's expression softened. "You rode into Clearwater knowing the town would judge you. You defended Emma in front of her father. You've faced down the Wildcats and the sheriff and half this town's prejudice. You're brave enough, Danny. You're just scared."

"Yeah," I admitted. "I am."

"Good," Frank said. "Means you care enough for it to matter. Now the question is whether you care enough to be honest with Emma instead of making decisions for her."

He walked back to the office, leaving me alone with the weight of everything I'd done wrong and the question of whether I was brave enough to fix it.

Emma deserved someone who trusted her strength.

Could I be that person?

Or had I already proven I wasn't?
