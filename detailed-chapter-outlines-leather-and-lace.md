- The Riders split off for their various jobs. Danny heads to Henderson's for weekly supply delivery. He describes Main Street versus his neighborhood—the visible class divide in Clearwater.

- Riding away, Danny tells himself to forget it. Girls like that don't mix with guys like him. Back at Miller's Garage, Frank notices Danny's distracted but doesn't push. Danny focuses on work, trying not to think about yellow sundresses.

- Emma makes conversation about the heat, asks how long he's been making deliveries, seems genuinely interested. Danny answers briefly but honestly, caught off guard by being treated like he matters.
- Leaving the store, Danny's thoughts are less steady than his hands on the handlebars. He tells himself she's just being nice because it's her job, but Emma Henderson's smile stays with him longer than it should.

- Emma asks if she could ride it sometime. Danny's caught between wanting to say yes and imagining her parents' reaction. He deflects with humor but the image of Emma on the back of his bike, arms around his waist, burns into his brain.
- Walking back inside, they're interrupted by a customer. Later, Frank notices Danny's been working extra on his bike—polishing chrome that's already clean. Frank smirks knowingly. Danny tells him to mind his business but doesn't deny it.

**Beats:**
- Delivery day when Emma's parents are at a church meeting. Emma's more relaxed, invites Danny to the back room while she checks the invoice. The informality feels significant.
- Emma talks about running the store, having business ideas her parents dismiss. They think she should focus on finding a husband, someone appropriate with prospects. Danny hears the frustration in her voice—everyone deciding her life for her.
- Danny shares his own experience with limitations—being judged as trouble before anyone knows him, people deciding who he is based on his jacket. Different restrictions, same feeling of being trapped by others' expectations.
- Emma asks what it's like to just ride away when things feel suffocating. Danny describes the freedom of the road honestly. Emma looks at him with longing, and Danny realizes they're more alike than different—both trapped by Clearwater's judgments, just on opposite sides of respectability.

- Internal monologue about why this is terrifying. Good girls and bad boys don't get happy endings in towns like Clearwater. Emma deserves someone respectable, someone whose reputation won't cost her everything. Danny knows this story, knows how it ends.
- Unable to sleep, Danny goes to Miller's Garage at 2 AM and works on a Rider's bike through the night. Hands busy, mind racing through all the reasons he should walk away from whatever's developing with Emma.
- Frank finds him at dawn still working, exhausted. Frank doesn't lecture, just tells Danny: whatever he's fighting, he needs to decide whether he's running from it or toward it, because standing still just means getting hit. Danny knows Frank's right. Knowing doesn't make choosing easier.

**Dialogue Topics:** Danny's internal monologue (no actual dialogue until Frank); Frank's observation about Danny's state and his advice about making a choice; Danny's non-answer that says everything.

- Margaret Henderson appears during the delivery, hurries Emma inside with a tight smile that's clearly forced. The message is clear: Emma's mother doesn't want her talking to the boy in the leather jacket. Danny sees Emma's frustration but also the cost of defying her mother.
- Danny makes the delivery quick and leaves, watching in his rearview mirror as Margaret talks to Emma in the store window. The body language tells him everything—disapproval, warning, concern. Emma is paying socially for every minute she spends with him.
- That night at the Riders' clubhouse, Tommy and others talk about summer plans and girls. Danny stays quiet, knowing he's being selfish just by wanting Emma. The right thing would be to pull back before her reputation is damaged beyond repair. But the thought of Thursday without seeing her feels impossible.

**Dialogue Topics:** Brief exchange with Emma before Margaret intervenes; Margaret's pointed comments; Riders' conversation about summer plans and girls; Danny's silence saying more than words.

- Danny tries to shorten Thursday's delivery, all business and no conversation. Emma notices immediately and confronts him outside before he can leave. She asks directly what's going on, why he's suddenly distant.
- Danny attempts deflection but Emma won't allow it. She calls him on pulling back, on being suddenly all business when they'd been becoming friends. She asks if she made him uncomfortable, if she did something wrong.
- Backed into honesty, Danny admits she didn't do anything wrong—that's the problem. He tells her she's too good for his world, that she deserves better than a guy whose reputation would cost her everything. It's the truth as he sees it.
- Emma's response surprises him: she gets angry, but not at him for his world—at him for deciding for her what she deserves. She tells him she's tired of everyone else deciding her life, and she thought he was different. Before Danny can respond, her father calls her inside. Emma walks away. Danny rides off feeling worse, not better.

**POV:** Danny Russo, first person  
**Setting:** Miller's Garage, Henderson General Store  
**Time:** Following week through next Thursday

**Beats:**
- Danny commits to real distance. He times deliveries for when Robert will be there, keeps conversations strictly professional, stops lingering. He tells himself this is protecting Emma, doing the right thing for her sake.
- The distance aches more than Danny expected. He catches himself looking for Emma's yellow sundress every Thursday despite his intentions. The Riders notice his deteriorating mood but respect his silence except for Frank.
- Frank pulls Danny aside and challenges his "noble suffering." He asks if Danny's actually protecting Emma or just protecting himself from the risk of trying and failing. Danny argues he's keeping Emma safe from his reputation. Frank counters: is Danny respecting Emma's strength or treating her like a child?
- Next Thursday, Emma isn't at the store—just Robert with a curt nod. Danny tells himself this is what he wanted, Emma safe and away from him. The hollowness in his chest says otherwise. He realizes Frank might be right—he's not being noble, he's being a coward.

**Dialogue Topics:** Danny's brief, professional exchanges with Robert; Frank's challenge about Danny's motivations; Danny's defenses about protecting Emma; Frank asking if Danny's respecting or infantilizing Emma's choices.

- Emma waits for Danny outside Henderson's after closing, intercepting him before he can leave. She's done letting him avoid her and her determination is visible in how she stands blocking his bike.

- Danny, cornered by her directness, admits he was trying to do the right thing by keeping distance. Emma asks who decided that was right—him or her? She points out he's making decisions about her life without asking what she wants, exactly like everyone else in town does.
- Danny argues he's trying to protect her reputation and future. Emma says maybe she doesn't want protection; maybe she wants a choice. She walks back inside, leaving Danny in the parking lot realizing she's right and he's been a coward disguised as noble.

- Danny tells her the truth: he likes her, has liked her for weeks, and that's exactly the problem. He's nineteen with a leather jacket and a motorcycle, she's the store owner's daughter with a future. His world costs people.
- Emma listens quietly, then asks if he thinks she's too weak to handle it. Danny says no—she's strong, which is why he doesn't want his world touching her. The stronger she is, the more she deserves better than what association with him brings.
- Emma asks what if she's willing to risk it. Danny admits he's terrified of being selfish enough to let her. They sit in careful silence, something shifting between them, possibility hanging in the warm summer air.

- She wants to talk to someone who treats her like she has a brain. She wants to feel something besides safe and suffocated. She likes Danny—his honesty, how he doesn't pretend, how he looks at her like she matters beyond her last name.
- Danny wants to believe her but fear keeps talking louder than hope. He tells her liking him will cost her everything—reputation, family approval, her place in respectable Clearwater. Emma says maybe some things are worth the cost.
- She asks if he's willing to find out. Danny doesn't answer because he genuinely doesn't know if he's brave enough. Emma walks away leaving him with a choice he's not sure he can make—but for the first time, the choice feels real, not already decided.

- Frank offers different advice: Danny needs to decide if he respects Emma enough to let her make her own choices or if he's going to treat her like a child who needs protecting. The question cuts deep because it reframes everything.
- Danny realizes they're all right. Emma is strong enough to choose, and his fear of hurting her is really about his own fear of trying and failing. Monday evening, Danny shows up at Henderson's as they're closing.
- Emma comes outside, surprised and hopeful. Danny tells her he's scared of being selfish, but he's more scared of walking away from something real. If she's willing to risk it, he is too. Emma smiles, and for the first time, Danny lets himself hope this might actually work.

- Emma's laughing at rigged games, sharing cotton candy, dragging Danny toward the Ferris wheel.

At the top of the Ferris wheel, stars overhead and Clearwater spread below, Emma takes his hand.
- Danny kisses her for the first time—soft, careful, the world narrowing to just them. When they come down, Emma's lipstick is smudged and Danny's heart is completely gone. He's fallen entirely and there's no going back.
- They run into Betty and her fiancé. The judgment is immediate and visible—Betty's disapproval, her fiancé's uncomfortable distance. Emma holds Danny's hand tighter and introduces him confidently. Danny realizes he's in too deep, completely fallen, and now he has to be worthy of Emma's choice.
