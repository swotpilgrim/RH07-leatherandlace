# Chapter 20: Walking Away

Thursday morning, I told Frank I was done making Henderson deliveries.

He looked up from the engine he was rebuilding, wrench in hand, his expression carefully neutral. "That so?"

"Tommy can take them." I kept my voice level, businesslike. "Or Mike. Doesn't matter. Just not me."

Frank set down the wrench with deliberate care. "You ask Emma what she wants?"

"No."

"Planning to?"

"No," I repeated, turning away to grab a rag I didn't need. "This isn't about what Emma wants. It's about what's right."

"And you get to decide what's right for her?" Frank's voice carried an edge. "That what you're saying?"

I spun to face him, frustration boiling over. "I saw her mother crying, Frank. I saw that spray paint on their store. I heard Robert Henderson ask if I'd done enough damage. So yeah, I'm deciding that continuing to cost Emma everything matters is the right call."

"Even if it breaks her heart?"

"Hearts heal," I said, though the words felt hollow. "Reputations don't. Not in towns like this."

Frank studied me for a long moment, his eyes seeing too much. "You're a coward, Danny."

The accusation hit hard because part of me agreed. "Maybe. But I'm a coward who's not going to destroy the girl I love."

"You think walking away without even talking to her first isn't destroying her?" Frank shook his head. "You're wrong. And you're making a mistake you'll regret."

"Probably," I admitted. "But it's my mistake to make."

Frank picked up his wrench again, his movements sharp with disapproval. "Tommy will take the delivery. But when Emma comes looking for you—and she will—that's on you to face."

I nodded and walked away before Frank could see how much his words cut.

I avoided Main Street entirely Thursday and Friday. Took the long way to the garage, worked late, threw myself into repairs that didn't require thought.

Tommy took the Henderson delivery Thursday. When he came back, he mentioned Emma had asked about me.

"What'd you tell her?" I asked.

"Told her you were busy. She didn't believe me." Tommy paused. "She looked hurt, man."

I didn't respond. Emma was hurt. She'd be more hurt. But eventually she'd understand.

At least that's what I told myself when sleep wouldn't come.

Friday evening, Frank mentioned Robert Henderson had asked if the Riders were changing delivery personnel permanently. "Told him Tommy would handle it. Robert seemed relieved."

"Good," I said, though it felt like dying.

Saturday afternoon, Emma found me.

I was alone in the garage, working on a transmission. I heard footsteps and assumed Tommy had come back.

"Hand me the three-quarter socket," I called out.

"I don't know what that is." Emma's voice hit me like a blow.

I straightened fast. Emma stood ten feet away in a yellow sundress, arms crossed, her expression a mixture of worry and anger and hurt.

"Emma—"

"You've been avoiding me."

I set down my tool. "Yeah."

"Why?" She stepped closer. "Tommy said you were busy. But that's not why. You're avoiding me on purpose."

I'd loved this about her—her refusal to accept anything less than honesty. Now it was going to force me to hurt her to her face.

"Yeah," I said again. "I am."

Emma's expression cracked slightly, hurt flashing across her face before she pushed it down. "Because of the vandalism? Danny, I told you I know you didn't—"

"This isn't about the vandalism," I interrupted. "It's about everything. The customers your family's losing, your best friend dropping you, your parents forbidding you from seeing me. All of it."

"None of that is your fault."

"Isn't it?" I met her eyes. "Your family's store got spray-painted because you're dating me. Your mother's crying. Betty won't talk to you. Customers are leaving. How is that not my fault?"

"Those are other people's choices. Their prejudice. Not your fault."

"But you're paying for it," I said quietly. "You're losing everything, and I can't keep watching that happen."

Understanding dawned in Emma's eyes, followed by anger. "So you're ending this? Making that decision for me?"

"Yes."

Emma's eyes filled with tears. "You don't get to do that."

"Emma—"

"No." She stepped closer. "You don't get to decide what I can handle. You don't get to make choices about my life without asking what I want."

"I know what you want," I said, frustration bleeding through. "You want to be brave, to stand up to everyone, to choose me anyway. But Emma, you're seventeen. You don't see—"

"Don't you dare," Emma interrupted, her voice shaking with fury. "Don't you dare tell me I'm too young to know my own mind. Everyone in this town treats me like a child who can't make her own decisions. My parents, the church ladies, Betty—everyone thinks they know better than me. I thought you were different."

The accusation cut deep. "I'm trying to protect you."

"From what?" Emma demanded. "From gossip? From people's judgment? From my family being upset? Those things are already happening, Danny. Walking away doesn't protect me from them—it just makes me face them alone!"

"You'll be better off without me," I insisted, even as the words tasted like lies. "Eventually you'll see that."

"Better off?" Emma's laugh was bitter. "I've lost my best friend, fought with my parents, watched customers leave our store, and dealt with people whispering about me. And you know what? I'd do it again. I'd do all of it again because being with you was worth it."

"It's not worth it," I said, my voice harder than I intended. "It's not worth losing everything."

"That's my decision to make!" Emma's tears spilled over now, tracking down her cheeks. "Not yours. Mine. And you're taking that choice away from me just like everyone else."

"Because I love you," I said, the words breaking. "I love you and I can't watch you lose your whole life for me."

"Then you don't love me the way I love you," Emma shot back. "Love means trusting someone. And you don't trust me to know what I want, what I can handle."

The words hit like a fist. "That's not—"

"Yes, it is," Emma said, her voice breaking. "You're just like my parents, like everyone in this town. You think you know better than me."

"Emma, that's not fair—"

"Fair?" Emma's voice rose. "You told me you loved me. You let me fight for us, stand up to my family, face this town. And now you're giving up. You're proving everyone right—that you'll just break my heart."

Each word cut deep. "I'm trying to do the right thing."

"The right thing would be trusting me!" Emma's hands shook. "The right thing would be letting me choose. The right thing would be being brave enough to stay instead of running because you're scared!"

"I'm not running—"

"Yes, you are," Emma said flatly. "You're terrified of how much you love me and what it might cost. So you're ending it first."

The accuracy stole my breath. She saw through me, always had.

"Maybe I am terrified," I admitted quietly. "Maybe I am scared of watching you lose everything. Is that so wrong?"

"Yes," Emma said, tears streaming down her face now. "Because you're not giving me a choice. You're deciding for me that I'm better off without you, that the cost is too high, that I don't know my own heart. And that—" Her voice broke. "That hurts worse than anything this town has done to me."

I reached for her instinctively, wanting to comfort her, but Emma stepped back.

"Don't," she said. "You don't get to break my heart and then try to make it better."

"Emma, please—"

"I thought you were different," she said, her voice small and devastated. "I thought you saw me as strong. I thought you believed in me."

"I do believe in you—"

"No, you don't," Emma interrupted. "If you believed in me, you'd trust me to make this choice. You'd trust that I know what I can handle, what I'm willing to face. But you don't. You think I'm too weak, too naive, too something to decide my own life."

"That's not true," I protested, but it sounded weak even to me.

Emma looked at me for a long moment, tears tracking down her cheeks, her expression breaking my heart in real time. "I love you, Danny. I love you enough to fight the whole town. But I can't fight you too. If you don't trust me, if you don't believe I'm strong enough for this, then maybe you're right. Maybe we can't do this."

She turned and walked toward the garage entrance, her shoulders shaking.

"Emma, wait—"

She stopped but didn't turn around. "You know what the worst part is? Everyone told me you'd break my heart. My parents, Betty, half the town. They all said the boy in the leather jacket would hurt me. And I defended you. I told them you were different, you were worth it, you'd never do what they expected."

She looked back over her shoulder, her face streaked with tears. "Turns out they were right. You did break my heart. Just not the way they expected."

Then she was gone, walking out of the garage into the afternoon sun, leaving me standing alone with an engine in pieces and the taste of regret choking me.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the empty doorway, Emma's words echoing in my head. *You're just like everyone else. You don't trust me. You think I'm not strong enough.*

Was she right? Was I taking away her choice because I didn't trust her to make it? Or was I protecting her from a cost she didn't fully understand yet?

I didn't know anymore. All I knew was the look on her face when she'd called me a coward, the tears streaming down her cheeks, the way her voice had broken when she said I'd broken her heart.

I'd tried to protect her. Tried to do the right thing.

But standing in that garage with Emma's absence heavy in the air and her accusation ringing in my ears, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd made a terrible mistake.

That Frank was right.

That I was a coward dressed up as noble.

And Emma—brave, fierce Emma who'd been willing to face the whole town for me—was paying the price for my fear.

I sank onto the garage's concrete floor, back against the wall, and let the weight of what I'd done crush me.

I'd walked away to protect her.

But all I'd done was prove everyone right and break both our hearts in the process.
